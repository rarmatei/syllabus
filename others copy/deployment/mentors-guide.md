# What's this?

A work-in-progress of content development around the topic of how students deploy their homework projects and portfolio projects.

### Envisaged deliverables:

1. Short (20 min) workshops to drop into relevant modules
2. Supporting reference material for students (e.g. cheatsheet) and teachers (lesson plan)
3. (optional) extra tooling (student project gallery / HW lookup)

# TODO:

- [ ] Write a workshop for netlify deploy via github (requiring no knowledge of command-line or npm)
- [ ] Write supporting reference material for students to access in future, including the student's HW submission duties regarding deployments (as stand-alone page so that teachers can simply and reliably link to it when assigning HW)
- [ ] Consider how to test for understanding during the workshop
  - [ ] Write a 5-minute kahoot for the first (or certainly second workshop) to check for understanding
- [ ] Write a group work exercise for the workshop
- [ ] Test all instructions with fresh accounts
- [ ] Test the workshop plan against another human
- [x] Write separate instructions for Create Netlify Account (+ github) so that we can...
  - [x] Assign the Create Netlify Account (+ github) as HW now (time-saver)
- [x] Discuss practice projects with Lucy and Sophie
- [ ] Generate three little test projects the students can fork and deploy (and perhaps modify) (landing page, CV & portfolio)
- [ ] Add mentor notes for "why not GH pages" - a link to wiki discussion page is fine?
- [ ] Write a trivial initial gallery tool (serves as test suite) during practice
- [ ] Deliver workshop over two weeks (20mins, 20 mins):
  - [ ] Week 1: the survival course
  - [ ] Week 2: refinements (e.g. temp vs final builds, DNS, branches)
  - [ ] Coord with React & JS3 module teachers so they know the approach taken so far

Later

- [ ] Bonus: Try to get budget (a sponsor) to have us buy a domain for each student for 1 or 2 years (caution: what happens when they can't afford it - all their links break. there's also the ownership hand-over, if CYF buy them initially)
- [ ] Bonus: get some cheapo custom domain(s) for the groups final projects (e.g. cyf-projects.io)

# Meta

## Guidelines for workshop content:

- K.I.S.S.
- Give them a recipe for what to do and have them practice it
- LATER weeks can see discussion of finer points (advantages, bigger picture, alternatives exist, etc)
- If possible, have a gallery in place, the students will detect when they have named incorrectly

## Simple all-student Gallery

- (list of students, list of projects, generates expected links to each project)
- Allows students to quickly test if their site naming is correct (and demonstrates to them WHY it matters with 40 students)
- get grads involved
