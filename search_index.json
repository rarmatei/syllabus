Now that you have\nbuilt a website in CodePen and learned the basics of HTML and CSS, it's time to\nlearn about the tools that web developers use in their everyday job. These tools\nwill be used during the course, so it is important that you become familiarised\nwith them.\nIn order to get started, we would like you to try to complete a task at home:\nmove your CodePen website to a web address under\nhttps://your-username.github.io/your-site-name.\nIn the process, you will learn how to store your code outside CodePen's website,\nin a location where other developers can make changes to it and view a history\nof all the updates that you have made.\nIf you wish to learn more about the concepts behind the steps we are suggesting\nbelow, please read the rest of this document.\nAnd remember: it's ok if you are stuck and don't know how to continue. At any\npoint, please ask for a mentor's help. We will cover these steps again in the\nlesson, and will explain them in more detail.\nHow to move your website to Github.io\n\nExport your website as a zip from CodePen\nExtract the contents of the zip file to a folder in your computer.\nKeep note of the location of this folder.\nRead about the terminal.\nRead about git.\nInstall Git.\nPut the contents of the zip folder in a Gitub repository.\nHow does Github work? (30min) >\nYou should now have a page with your code under\nhttp://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.\nThis is a view of your code, and you should see a list of your files,\nincluding an index.html.\nNow all that remains is to publish your website! Still under\nhttp://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name,\nfind the settings icon in the top right corner.\n\n\nFind the section named \"Github Pages\" and select \"master branch\" in source,\nthen hit \"Save\".\n\n\nWait a few minutes, then refresh the page and come back to the Github Pages\nsection. You should see a green bar saying \"Your site is published at\nhttp://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name\". Click the link,\nverify that your website is there, then share it with your CYF class!\n\n\nTerminal basics\nDuring your course journey and onwards, the terminal (also known as\ncommand line) will be one of your most valuable tools. It will help you to\ninteract with you computer faster, by helping you to:\n\nCreate and delete files.\nInstall web development tools.\nStart a server.\nUse source control (explained later in this lesson).\n\nAll this will make sense as we progress with the lessons. For now, we would like\nyou to get familiar with it by following this tutorial:\n\nLearn the command line\n\nHow do I use it on my computer\nSo now that you know what the terminal can do for you, how do you use it? Please\nfind instructions for your operating system below. After you have followed the\ninstructions, open a terminal and write ls, then press the Enter key. You\nwill see something like this:\n\nCommonly used commands\nThere's a set of commands you should become comfortable with during the course\nto allow you to effectively move around the filesystem\nand write software on your laptop.\n\ncd - change directory. To move up into the parent directory use: cd ..\nls - list the contents of a directory.\nCan also be used as ls [directory_name] to list the contents\nof a specific directory without actually moving (with cd) to it\npwd - print the full location of your current directory\nmkdir [name] - create a new directory, with the given name after a space\ntouch [file_name] - create a new file, with the given name\n(don't forget to add the extension, like .css or .html)\nrm [file_name] - remove a file\nrm -r [directory_name] - remove a directory (and all files inside that directory)\n\nLinux\nThe Terminal is already installed.\nIt should be in the list of applications available in your computer.\nMore instructions\nmacOS (Apple)\nThe Terminal is already installed.\nIt should be in the list of applications available in your computer.\nMore instructions\nWindows\nInstall Git.\nIt will bring with it a tool called \"Git Bash\".\nWhen the mentors ask you to open a terminal or command line,\nplease open \"Git Bash\".\nGit\nWe will use Git as our Version Control System (also known as Source Control).\nIt's like Dropbox for developers. But much better!\n\nWhat is \"version control\"? Version control is a system that records\nchanges to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific\nversions later.\nIt allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire\nproject back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last\nmodified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue\nand when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things\nup or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for\nvery little overhead.\nExtract from\nGit Pro book\n\nThis answer on StackOverflow by\nsi618 explains very well why we use Version Control.\nSo what is Git? Git is one of many Version Control Systems available to use,\nand by far\nthe most popular.\nWhat is Github? Github is a very popular site where you can publish and\nshare your Git repositories, share and collaborate with other people.\nGet Started\nFollow this tutorial from Github to setup Git:\nhttps://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git\nThen\nlearn how to use git from the Terminal\nTry completing this tutorial as well to learn more\nintermediate features, like branching.\nA typical workflow\n\nIf you're basing your work from another project,\nthe first step is typically to fork their repo.\nRead this guide for instructions:\nhttps://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo\n\nIf you're starting a new project then you should follow these steps\nhttps://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line\n\n\nUsing Git through the Terminal\n\ngit init if it is a new project, i.e. a project not cloned from a\nrepo (or a fork of a repo)\ngit add . to add local files to the index\ngit commit -m \"Good explanation of your file changes\" to commit files to the\nlocal repo\ngit remote add origin GitRepoRemoteUrl if it is a new project (to\nsetup the remote url)\ngit remote -v to verify that the remote url is set correctly\ngit push -u origin master to push your commits to the remote url (Github in\nour case)\n\nYou will also typically need to set up your email and name once\nwhen you install Git git config --global user.name  and\ngit config --global user.email.\nUsing Git through a graphical interface\nIf you don't feel comfortable with the terminal just yet, download the\nGithub client. If possible, however, we\nrecommend becoming comfortable with the Terminal commands and understanding the\nsteps for the different workflows before moving on to visual Git clients.\nGithub client guides\nPull Requests\nYou should also learn how to create and work with\nPull Requests.\nGithub\nDuring our course, we will be using Github to store our\ncode. Github is the most popular Git service around, and is used by many large\ncompanies, like Facebook, Airbnb and The Guardian.\nCodeYourFuture's Github page\nMore Resources\n\nFollow this tutorial to learn the basic Git commands:\nhttps://www.pluralsight.com/courses/how-git-works\nAnother good resource: Git - the simple guide:\nhttps://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\nA more detailed tutorial that goes into advanced topics of Git:\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control\nYou can also check this visual explanation of different commands\nand what they do:\nhttp://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace\nThere are GUI software - Gitkraken is one of them:\nhttps://www.gitkraken.com/\nThis Glossary has definitions of the terms normally used with Git:\nhttps://help.github.com/en/articles/github-glossary\n\nIDE\nIDE stands for \"Integrated Development Environment\". It is the software that you\nwill be using to write most of your code. It is designed to help you develop\nyour apps quickly, focusing on the problems that you need to solve instead of\nhaving to search Google for minor details.\nAuto-complete\nOne of the most important features of an IDE is that it provides\n\"auto-completion\". This means that it will give you suggestions of what you can\ncan write next, while you are typing something.\nFor example, when writing a CSS property, it will tell you what values you can\nassign it to.\n\nFile tree view\nThe reason why we call it \"Integrated\" is that you almost don't need to leave\nthe window to write your app. For example, creating, renaming and moving files\ncan be done directly from the IDE. This functionality can be achieved from\nsomething called a \"Tree view\", which you can usually find on the left side of\nyour IDE.\n\nFinding files\nWhen working with big projects, you will often need to find a file quickly,\nwithout having to go through the tree view manually.\n\nMost IDEs will allow you to do this with a sequence of keys.\nVSCode sequence: Windows/Linux Ctrl + P | Mac Cmd + P\nInstall an IDE\nFor this course, we recommend the usage of\nVS Code. Please go ahead and install it, then\ntry opening an HTML file with it via File > Open.\nInstall VS Code\nOther IDEs\nBesides VS Code, the IDEs below are also popular with web developers. Feel free\nto check out their websites and see the differences between them and VS Code.\n\nAtom\nWebstorm\n\nAirtame\nDuring our classes, Students and Mentors will share their code with the rest of the class using a tool\ncalled Airtame to present their laptop screen wirelessly to the projector.\nThe instructions below were tested on Ubuntu only. Installation will differ on Mac OSX.\nTo install Airtame:\n\nDownload the Airtame version for Ubuntu here.\nIn the Terminal, navigate to the directory you downloaded the file. For example,\nif you downloaded Airtame to your Downloads directory:\n$ cd ~/Downloads\nThe downloaded file should have .tar.gz extension. You can see the full name with:\n$ ls airtame*\n\nExtract the file using:\n$ tar -xzf  replacing  with the name of the downloaded file.\nThe command above will extract the contents of the downloaded file into a directory of the same name.\n\nLaunch Airtame with the following command:\n$ .//launch-airtame.sh replacing  with the directory created in the previous step.\n\nInstall Airtame with the following command:\n$ .//install.sh\nThis will create a shortcut (icon) so you can launch Airtame from your Applications\n\n\nCommon Issues\nIf you have errors returned when executing launch-airtame.sh or install.sh you may need to install\none or more missing libraries in your System. Check the error message and:\n\nIf it contains libgtk-x11 as part of the message, then execute the following command:\n$ sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0\nIf it contains libgconf as part of the message, then execute the following comand:\n$ sudo apt-get install libgconf2.0\n\nFor any other errors, contact the Mentors on Slack, including the error message from the Terminal.\nHomework\n\nIf you have not yet moved your website from CodePen to Github, do it now.\nPlease use the information in this section to complete it.\nWhen your website is live at https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name,\nplease send a link to the slack channel of your class.\nLearn how to navigate your computer using a Terminal (view files, copy files).\nInstall VS Code.\nOpen your website with VS Code and add something to it: text, images, update\nCSS. Commit your changes to Github and verify that\nhttps://your-username.github.io/your-site-name has been updated!\n\nIt's alright if you are getting stuck or if something doesn't look right! When\nit happens, please ask your mentors or classmates for help in Slack.\n"},"html-css/":{"url":"html-css/","title":"HTML/CSS","keywords":"","body":"HTML & CSS\n\n\n\nWeeks\nContent\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nweek-1\nSemantic HTML tags .

(Wikipedia)\n\nPrinciples - During the course, we will highlight principles that apply to the specific topic but also to Computer Science and Programming in general. It is important to understand these principles, terms and apply them to your thinking in general.\n\nHTML Syntax\nYou're already familiar with HTML code from your application process. If you want to refresh your memory, read this quick guide to the HTML syntax.\nAll together, let's review the basic syntax in the following example:\n\n  Learning HTML\n  Get to know the HTML basics.\n  Read Article\n\n\n\nExercise Which parts are the Tags and which parts are the Attributes.\n\nHTML tags are arranged in a hierarchy. This is sometimes called \"nesting\" tags or creating an HTML \"tree\". Between the opening  tag and the closing  tag there are three other tags. We call these \"child\" tags, because they have a parent-child relationship.\n\n\nExercise As a group, let's try to name all of the parent and child tags in the following example.\n\n\n  Learning HTML\n  \n    Author:\n    Code Your Future\n  \n  Get to know the HTML basics.\n  Read Article\n\n\nExample HTML/CSS Project\nIn today's class, we will begin adapting styles on this example website. We'll review some of the HTML/CSS basics you already encountered during your application process and learn some new techniques. By the end of the third lesson, we will have worked together to improve the example site on the left so that it looks like the screenshot on the right.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nThe example website you'll begin working with is available on this Code Your Future GitHub repository -\nBikes for Refugees. Fork the repository to your personal account and use the following terminal commands to download the files to your projects folder.\n\ncd ~\ncd \ngit clone git@github.com:/bikes-for-refugees.git\n\n\nExercise: Spend a few minutes exploring the .html and .css files for this page. Why don't we put everything in one file?\n\nSemantic HTML\nWhen writing HTML code, you can use different tags to describe the content. Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired.\n\nSemantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Wikipedia\n\nWe'll cover the following semantic tags:\n\n\n\nThe role=\"main\" attribute\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise (pair programming): Work in pairs to determine where to place these new Tags and Attributes in the index.html file. Who benefits when we write \"semantic\" HTML?\n\nCSS Selectors\nDuring your application process, you became familiar with CSS selectors. We'll review the basic selectors and then practice combining these to modify our button styles.\n\nIf you want to review the selectors, read the Common Selectors section of this page.\nExercise (pair programming): Work in pairs to make the blue buttons on the page red (#ce5f31). The white button, which says \"Volunteer\", should remain white but the text should change to red.\n\nPseudo Classes\nYou can assign CSS rules to a class like this:\n.btn {\n  background: #ce5f31;\n}\n\nThere are also things called \"pseudo\" classes. In this section, we'll introduce you to the common pseudo classes for assigning styles to interactions, such as moving your mouse over a link.\n\n\"pseudo\" is a fancy word for \"fake\". We call them \"pseudo\" classes because they're not really there in the HTML, but the browser knows what to do with them.\n\nHere's an example of a pseudo class which changes the color of a link when the mouse moves over it.\n.btn:hover {\n  background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\nNot everyone uses a mouse. Some users will prefer a keyboard, where they can hit tab to move between links on a page. So that they can see where they are, you should add effects to the :focus pseudo class too.\n.btn:hover,\n.btn:focus {\n  background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the pseudo classes to make the background color of the red buttons change when in a \"hover\" or \"focus\" state. See if you can make the white \"Volunteer\" button change to a different background without effecting the red buttons.\n\nBox Model\nIn CSS, everything is a box. An image is a box. A link is a box. The area around this box can be modified with properites that we call margins, borders and padding. Here's a diagram showing what the box looks like.\n\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the margin and padding rules to spread your navigation links out a bit wider. There should be a small gap between them and enough padding so that the border is not too tight on the text.\n\nYou may have noticed that the border you added to the navigation links causes the links to jump around when you move your mouse over them. That's because the border is adding to the width of the box model, pushing the others to the side.\nYou can also set a transparent border, so that it takes up the space without showing a visible border.\n.navlink {\n  border: 1px solid transparent;\n}\n\n\nExercise: Use a transparent border so that the width of each navigation menu item stays the same even when it is hovered or focused.\n\nGit Conflicts\nAs a professional, you'll usually need to work alongside other coders to build an app or website. We use version control to coordinate changes and manage any conflicts that arise. Git is a version control system which helps us merge code that we've been working on separately into one common codebase.\nTo manage conflicts, we will need a common code base in which all changes are coordinated. When working on our own, we'll make our changes in branches to keep the code separate. Then we'll learn how to refresh your individual branch with the common code base, and prepare your changes to be merged.\n\nExercise: Get together in pairs and select a \"leader\". The leader should fork this repository to their GitHub account. The other person should then fork the leader's repository. Both students should then clone their own personal forks locally.\n\nNow that you have the project set up on your computer, you need a place to safely make changes without effecting the common code base. To do this, we'll navigate to our project in the Terminal and create a new branch:\ncd \ngit checkout -b my-first-branch\n\nWhen you commit changes on this branch, your changes will be saved separately from the common code base. This way both team members can make changes at the same time.\n\nExercise: Add your name and a sentence about yourself to the index.html file. Then git add and git commit to commit to your personal branch.\n\nNow you have two branches: master and my-first-branch. These branches have diverged, which means you have changes in one that don't appear in the other. You can check this by running git checkout master, then looking at your index.html file.\nWhen you're done, run git checkout my-first-branch to go back to the branch with your changes. Git saves your changes in both branches and lets you switch between them. That's why we call it \"version control\". It saves different versions so you can switch between them.\nRight now, your new branch only exists on your computer. Let's push it up to GitHub so you can see it in your profile.\ngit checkout my-first-branch\ngit push -u origin my-first-branch\n\nNow both students in each pair, the \"leader\" and the other student, should have branches with changes. Now let's try to merge these changes together into the \"leader's\" master branch.\n\nExercise: Browse to the \"leader's\" GitHub repository and open a new Pull Request. The Pull Request should ask to merge your my-first-branch branch into the \"leader's\" master branch. Ask a mentor for help if you have trouble figuring out how to issue a Pull Request. When both students have issued a Pull Request to the correct place, merge one of them but not the other.\n\nCongrats, you've merged one student's changes with the common code base in the master branch. If you check the other Pull Request, you'll see you have a problem. It can't be merged automatically because there's a conflict. Why?\nConflicts emerge whenever the same file has been edited, and git can't determine what changes should be kept and what changes should be discarded. A human -- that's you -- needs to step in and sort it out. To help us, git writes into our code so we can see where it is confused. Here's an example of a merge conflict in our code:\nMozafar\n+   I am a mentor at CodeYourFuture.\n=======\n-   Daniel\n-   I like to ride bikes\n>>>>>>> my-first-branch\n\nTo resolve a conflict, we decide which lines to keep and which lines to remove. When we're done, we remove the extra lines that git added (, ======== and >>>>>>>).\nLet's see how we can resolve this conflict with your branches. First we need to fetch the latest changes from the leader's master branch. If you're the leader, just do:\ngit checkout master\ngit pull\n\nIf you're the other student, you need to set up the remote and pull from that master:\ngit checkout master\ngit remote add upstream \ngit pull upstream master\n\nNow everyone's master branch should include the Pull Request that was merged. Whichever student still needs to get their Pull Request merged can bring those changes into their branch like this:\ngit checkout my-first-branch\ngit merge master\n\nYou probably received a merge conflict.\n\nExercise: Follow the steps we discussed before about how to resolve a merge conflict by editing the file. Make sure both students changes are included in the final version. When you're done, use git add, git commit and git push to share your changes with GitHub. If everything has gone correctly, you can now merge the Pull Request.\n\nNow everyone can sync their changes. If you're the leader, just do:\ngit checkout master\ngit pull\n\nIf you're the other student, do this:\ngit checkout master\ngit pull upstream master\n\n\nExercise: As a group, discuss why the git pull command is different for the leader and the other student.\nExercise: Try to do the pull requests again, but this time switch the pull requests so that the other student must manage the merge conflict.\n\nIf you're feeling confused, don't worry. Version control is one of the most difficult things you'll learn and we'll be going over it again and again and again.\nResources\n\nHTML5 - semantic elements\nCSS Selectors - MDN\nThe Cascade - MDN\nBox Model - MDN\nBox Model, box-sizing: border-box - CSS Tricks\nCSS specificity - MDN\nPseudo classes - MDN\n\nHomework\nYou can find the homework for this week here\nPrepare for the next class\n\n(Est. 4-5 hours) Complete the first three lessons in this course on Responsive Web Design Fundamentals.

To ensure we're presenting a website that's easy to use on any device, we use Responsive Web Design techniques to modify how content is displayed depending on the viewport.\n\nExercise: As a group, let's brainstorm as many devices as we can think of which might access the websites we build.\n\nSee how much variety there is in viewport sizes.\nMedia Queries\nAs you learned in your homework assignment, media queries help us change the display of our content depending on the size of the viewport. Let's review what you learned and break down a media query:\n@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {\n  body {\n    background: red;\n  }\n}\n\nIn this media query, we're assigning a red background color to the  element whenever the viewport is larger than 900px, and we're viewing on a screen.\n\n@media starts the media query\nscreen tells it to apply these styles to screen displays. Other displays\nmight be print, for when a webpage is being printed.\n(min-width: 900px) tells it to apply these styles when the viewport is\nlarger than 900px\n\nFinally, we wrap all of our styles for this media query in brackets ({ and }), just like a CSS rule.\n\nExercise: Working in pairs, reduce the size of the \"Bikes for Refugees\" text so that it fits on a small screen (320px). But make sure it increases in size on larger screens.\nExercise: The two buttons in the jumbotron don't fit on the same line on small screens around 320px wide. Can you adjust their size so that they fit on the same line?\n\nFlexbox\nFlexbox is a name for a set of CSS layout rules which are supported in newer browsers. They allow you to apply rules to elements to place them side-by-side and re-arrange them. You just specify how you want your elements arranged and the browser will scale this arrangement depending on the screen size and device used for viewing.\nMost flexbox rules are applied to the container, to tell it how to arrange its children. However, there are some rules that can be applied to children as well.\nYou can see all the rules that can be applied to both the container and the children here:\nhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\n\nExercise: Continue editing the \"Bike for refugees\" website by adding 3 boxes below Jumbotron, and using Flexbox, make sure they are arranged like in the sketch below:\n\n\nYou can start with something like the below, by just adding a container, and the 3 text pieces within it. Try to use flexbox to position the text elements within the container to match the picture:\n\n  \n  Check availability\n  Donate bikes\n  Volunteer with us\n\n\n\nOnce that's done you can move on to creating boxes for each individual text piece, and again, using flexbox to position the text piece in the middle of its box.\n\nLet's take a break from flexbox for a minute. Do you remember the :first-child psuedo class? There's a :last-child psuedo class as well.\n\nExercise: See if you can use these psuedo classes to give the left box a grey background (#ddd) and the right box a grey border (1px solid #ddd). Use this screenshot to guide you.\n\nHomework\nYou can find the homework for this week here\nPrepare for the next class\n\n(Est. 1 hour) You may remember Bootstrap from your application process.

It is sometimes called a \"design system\", \"style guide\", or \"pattern library\", and will usually consist of three things:\n\nBrand guidelines define the appropriate typography, colors and logos to use.\nComponents define re-usable code snippets for common requirements, like navigation menus.\nHelpers define additional code tools to construct the site, like layout grids.\n\nThe main goals of a design framework are to ensure design consistency and avoid writing the same code twice.\nBootstrap 4\nBootstrap is CSS and JavaScript code that we load in our HTML pages. Bootstrap's documentation describes how to write HTML code that fits the Bootstrap components, including a grid layout as well as several components.\n\nExercise: Fork this repository and follow the instructions in the readme to create a new page and add a card component to it.\nExercise: Perform a group exercise exploring the git workspace. Then create a branch, commit your new page, and issue a pull request. Once all the pull requests are merged, switch back to the master branch and update your copy.\n\nDid you know there are other open-source HTML/CSS frameworks you can try? Two popular ones are Bulma and Foundation.\nPersonal Websites\nOver the last two weeks, you've been building personal websites as part of your homework. Now we want you to take those websites and apply the knowledge you've learned to make them as good as you can. Some ideas:\n\nAdd Bootstrap 4 to your site and use some of the components.\nUse re-usable class names to reduce your CSS code.\nValidate your HTML code to find and fix problems.\nAdd a second page and link to it from your first page.\nTry to style the first article differently so that it stands out from the rest.\n\nBy the end, you should have created a repository for your site on GitHub with all the commits you've made.\nRetrospective\nAt the end of each module, we'll have a retrospective. What went right? What went wrong? What can we do better to help you learn?

This is the repo we will use during the class, and for homework.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nAccess to a Linux console (either on Mac, Ubuntu or by using Ubuntu WSL for Windows 10)\nVS Code running a default Linux terminal\nNodeJS must be installed\n\nTo test, you can write node -v in your terminal and you should see something like v11.10.0. If you don't see this please talk to a teacher!\nHello World\nIt is programming tradition that the first thing you do in any language is make it output 'Hello world!'.\nWe'll do this in JavaScript, using a command called console.log(). The console.log() method writes a message to the console.\nThe console is a tool which is mainly used to log information - it's useful for testing purposes.\nExercise (10 minutes)\n(This exercise will help you understand how to run a basic JS script and explore the different ways you can run JS code)\n\nCreate your first js1-week1.js script\nType console.log(\"Hello World!\")\nThere are 2 ways you can run this script - one way is by pressing F5 in your VS Code application. Can you find out what the second way is? Pair up and use a search engine to find out! Choose your favourite method and use that from now on.\n\nBONUS: there is a third way of running JS code (notice how I haven't said scipt) - do you know what that is?\nExercise (5 minutes)\n(This exercise will help you expand your understanding of console.log)\nWrite 10 statements like these, but in different languages.\nFor example:\nHalo, dunia! // Indonesian\nCiao, mondo! // Italian\nHola, mundo! // Spanish\nVariables\nWhen you write code, you'll want to create shortcuts to data values so you don't have to write out the same value every time.\nWe can use a variable to create a reference to a value. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.\nBefore you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with let and const keywords as follows.\nlet greeting = \"Hello world\";\n\nconsole.log(greeting);\n\nconst name = \"Irina\";\n\nconsole.log(name);\n\nThe program above will print \"Hello world\" to the console. Notice how it uses the value assigned to the variable greeting.\nExercise (5 minutes)\n\nAdd a variable greeting to js1-week1.js and assign a greeting of your choice to the variable\nPrint your greeting to the console 3 times. You should see your greeting 3 times on the console, one on each line.\n\nStrings\nIn programming there are different types of data. You've used one data type already: string.\nComputers recognise strings as a sequence of characters but to humans, strings are simply lines of text.\nconst message = \"This is a string\";\n\nNotice that strings are always wrapped inside of quote marks. We do this so that the computer knows when the string starts and ends.\nYou can check that the data is a string by using the typeof operator:\nconst message = \"This is a string\";\nconst messageType = typeof message;\n\nconsole.log(messageType); // logs 'string'\n\nExercise (5 minutes)\n\nWrite a program that:\n\ncreates a variable called colors\n\nassigns colors \"blue\" and \"yellow\" as a comma separate string to colors\nlogs the type colors using typeof.\n\nWhat is the typeof a number?\n\n\nString concatenation\nYou can add two strings together using the plus operator (+) or string interpolation.\nString interpolation is a useful JavaScript feature that allows you to put variables directly into a string:\n// Here is an example using the plus operator to concat strings\nconst greetingStart = \"Hello, my name is \";\nconst name = \"Daniel\";\n\nconst greeting = greetingStart + name;\n\nconsole.log(greeting); // Logs \"Hello, my name is Daniel\"\n\n// Here is example using the String interpolation to concat strings\nconst greetingStart = \"Hello\";\nconst name = \"Daniel\";\n\nconst greeting = `${greetingStart}, my name is ${name}`;\n\nconsole.log(greeting); // Logs \"Hello, my name is Daniel\"\n\nExercise (5 mins)\n\nWrite a program that logs a message with a greeting and your name using the two concatenation methods we used\n\nNumbers as integers\nThe next data type we will learn is number.\nUnlike strings, numbers do not need to be wrapped in quotes.\nconst age = 30;\n\nYou can use mathematical operators to calculate numbers:\nconst sum = 10 + 2; // 12\nconst product = 10 * 2; // 20\nconst quotient = 10 / 2; // 5\nconst difference = 10 - 2; // 8\n\nExercise (10 mins)\n\nCreate two variables numberOfStudents and numberOfMentors\nLog a message that displays the total number of students and mentors\n\nExpected result\nNumber of students: 15\nNumber of mentors: 8\nTotal number of students and mentors: 23\n\nNumbers as decimals\nNumbers can be integers (whole numbers) or floats (numbers with a decimal).\nconst preciseAge = 30.612437;\n\nNumbers with decimals can be rounded to the nearest whole number using the Math.round function:\nconst preciseAge = 30.612437;\nconst roughAge = Math.round(preciseAge); // 31\n\nExercise (15 mins)\n\nUsing the variables provided in the exercise calculate the percentage of mentors and students in the group (percentages must be a rounded to the nearest integer)\nUsing online documentation, what other things can you do with the Math library? Pick one thing on your table that you can do other than Math.round and prepare an explanation for the rest of the class\n\nExpected result\nPercentage students: 65%\nPercentage mentors: 35%\n\nFunctions\nFunctions are blocks of code that can do a task as many times as you ask them to. They take an input and return an output.\nHere's a function that doubles a number:\nfunction double(number) {\n  return number * 2;\n}\n\nTo use the function we need to:\na) call it with an input and\nb) do something with the returned value, for example assigning it to a variable\nconst result = double(2);\n\nconsole.log(result); // 4\n\nThe input given to a function is called a parameter.\nA function can take more than one parameter:\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nWhen you write a function (sometimes called declaring a function) you assign names to the parameters inside of the parentheses (()). Parameters can be called anything.\nThis function is exactly the same as the on above:\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n  return num1 + num2;\n}\n\nExercise (20 minutes)\n\nIn pairs, design and create a function that:\n\ntakes in more than one input\n\nuses string concatenation\nthis means adding two strings together\nperforms some form of operation on a number\nuses return to return a string\n\nAdd a comment above your function to explain what it does\n\nCall your function and run your script\nWhat's the difference between a return and console.log?\nWhen would you choose to use functions over the way we have been scripting so far?\n\nExercise (10 minutes)\n\nSwap your laptop with your neighbouring pair and review each other's code - what can be improved? Is the code readable?\n\nCalling functions inside functions\nFunctions are very powerful.\n\nYou can write more than one line of code inside of functions.\nYou can use variables inside of functions.\nYou can call other functions inside of functions!\n\nfunction getAgeInDays(age) {\n  return age * 365;\n}\n\nfunction createGreeting(name, age) {\n  const ageInDays = getAgeInDays(age);\n  const message =\n    \"My Name is \" + name + \" and I was born over \" + ageInDays + \" days ago!\";\n  return message;\n}\n\nExercise (20 mins)\n\nWrite a function that returns the year someone is born given their age as input\nUsing the answer from step 1, write a function that takes someone's name and age as input and returns a string that states the person's name and year they were born in a sentence\n\nGlossary\n\nConsole: a place on your computer to run scripts or commands from\nCommand: something that you type on your computer which performs an operation that your computer does\nDirectory: another word for \"folder\" on your computer\nParameter: a placeholder for values you can pass into functions\nPrimitive type: a built-in type in JavaScript (e.g. strings and numbers are primitive types in JavaScript)\nScript: a file that contains a program\nTerminal: another word for \"console\"\n\nHomework\nFork the JavaScript-Core-1-Homework repo repo and solve all exercises in the week-1/mandatory.

We will use these words frequently to describe code.\nExpression\nAn expression returns a value. Sometimes we will say that an expression evaluates to a value.\nThe following are all examples of expressions:\n1 + 1; // returns 2\n(\"hello\"); // returns \"hello\"\n2 * 4; // returns 8\n\"Hello\" + \"World\"; // returns \"HelloWorld\"\n\nWe can take the value produced by an expression and assign it to a variable. That line of code would be called a statement.\nExpressions can also contain variables.\nfunction greetingPlanet() {\n  const planet = \"Earth\";\n  return `Hello ${planet}`; // returns Hello Earth\n}\n\nYou can also use expressions inside a string interpolation or as a return value.\nconsole.log(`2 + 4 is ${2 + 4}`); // 2 + 4 is 6\n\nfunction double(num) {\n  return num * 2; // expression being returned\n}\n\nStatement\nA statement is some code that performs an action. Here are some examples:\nconst sum = 1 + 1; // action: assigns result of `1 + 1` to variable `sum`\nconst greeting = \"hello\"; // action: assigns result of the expression \"hello\" to variable `greeting`\nconsole.log(2 * 4); // action: logs the result of `2 * 4` to the console\nsayGreeting(greeting); // action: calls the function `sayGreeting` with the parameter `greeting`\n\nThere are some other different types of statements that we will learn in the coming weeks.\nYou can run node by itself, which will open a node console, also called a Read–Eval–Print Loop (REPL).\nThis console allows you to run expressions in the console line by line and is a great way of testing bits of code before writing it in a script.\nExercise (5 mins)\nIn your VS Code terminal, run the command node and run the following expressions. What are their outputs? Is there anything you didn't expect? (To exit the node REPL, you have to click Ctrl+d or Cmd+D on Mac)\n\n1 + 2\n\"hello\"\nlet favouriteColour = \"purple\"\nfavouriteColour\nconsole.log(favouriteColour)\n\nBooleans\nThere is another primitive type in JavaScript known as a boolean value. A boolean is either true or false, and it should be written without quotes.\nlet codeYourFutureIsGreat = true;\nlet thisIsATerribleClass = false;\n\nExercise (10 mins)\n\nIn a node REPL, what is the typeof a true or false?\nPair up and correct the following function so that the output returns \"You've given me a bool, thanks!\"\n\nfunction boolChecker(bool) {\n  if (typeof bool === ) {\n    return \"You've given me a bool, thanks!\";\n  }\n\n  return \"No bool, not cool.\";\n}\n\nboolChecker(true);\n\n\nAs a class, can you step through the function and explain what each line does?\n\nComparison Operators\nIn the previous exercise, you used an expression that returns a boolean value. This was possible because of the comparison operator ===. Using a comparison operator will always return a boolean value.\nAssert\nWe will also be using a new keyword to make sure the comparisons we do below return true. This is the assert.\nWhen given true, it does nothing. Nice. When given false, it will error. It is very good for testing things you expect to be true.\nHere's an expression that evaluates to a boolean.\nCan you work out what will happen with the code below?\nassert(1 > 2);\n// and...\nassert(2 \nThe > symbol in the expression is a comparison operator. Comparison operators compare two values. This operator checks to see if the number on the left is bigger than the number on the right.\n>   greater than\n=  greater than or equal\n=== same value and same type\n!== not the same value and type\n\nYou might see people use two other comparison operators. They are valid, but are the evil twins of === and !== and it is generally considered bad practice because of the bugs the can cause.\n✘ - Do not use == and !=\n== equal compares only value\n!= unequal compares only value\n\n✔ - Do use === and !==\n=== equal compares both value and type\n!== unequal compares both value and type\n\nIf you see these, suggest people change them in pull requests.\nExercise (5 mins)\n\nModify the values below to have the compare function return the desired value:\n\nconst assert = require(\"assert\");\n\nconst mentorCount = // TODO\nconst studentCount = // TODO\nassert(mentorCount  people);\n\nconst name1 = // TODO\nconst name2 = // TODO\nassert(name1 === name2);\n\nconst number1 = // TODO\nconst number2 = // TODO\nassert(number1 !== number2);\n\nconst thisNumber = // TODO\nconst thatNumber = // TODO\nassert(thisNumber === thatNumber);\n\nconst thisArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst thatArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nassert(thisArray === thatArray);\n\nThe array comparison doesn't work because JavaScript comparison only works as expected on numbers, strings, and booleans.\nYou need to be aware of this, and its possible for you to go deeper into array comparisons outside of the lesson, though generally remember that only numbers, strings, and booleans work with equality.\nMDN has some slightly in-depth documentation here.\nConditionals\nLike humans, computer programs make decisions based on the information given to them. Conditionals are a way of representing these decisions in code (remember, you saw this in a previous exercise!)\nFor example:\n\nIn a game, if the player has 0 lives, then the game is over\nIn a weather app, if rain is forecast, a picture of rain clouds is shown\n\nThe most common type of conditional is the if statement.\nAn if statement runs some code if a condition is met. If the condition is not met, then the code will be skipped.\nlet isHappy = true;\n\nif (isHappy) {\n  console.log(\"I am happy\");\n}\n\nThe code in paratheses - e.g. (isHappy) - is the condition. The condition can be any expression. The following are all valid conditions:\n// boolean value\nif (true) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// variable assigned to boolean value\nlet isHappy = true;\nif (isHappy) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// equality operator returns a boolean value\nif (1 + 1 === 2) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// comparison operator returns a boolean value\nif (10 > 5) {\n  // do something\n}\n\n// function call returns boolean value\nif (greaterThan10(5)) {\n  // do something\n}\n\nAn if statement runs code when a condition is met. What if the condition is not met? Sometimes you want to run an alternative bit of code.\nAn if...else statement also runs code when the condition is not met.\nlet isHappy = true;\n\nif (isHappy) {\n  console.log(\"I am happy &#x1F604;\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"I am not happy &#x1F622;\");\n}\n\nWhat if there is more than one condition you want to handle in your function? For example, what if you can be confused as well? You can use else if to handle multiple conditions.\nExercise (5 mins)\nCan you explain what this function does line by line? What happens when you pass in a string?\nfunction numberChecker(num) {\n  if (num > 20) {\n    return `${num} is greater than 20`;\n  } else if (num === 20) {\n    return `${num} is equal to 20`;\n  } else if (num \nExercise (10 mins)\nCreate a function that gives you a message depending on your mood! It should:\n\ntake one input\nreturn \"Good job, you're doing great!\" if you pass in \"happy\"\nreturn \"Every cloud has a silver lining\" if you pass in \"sad\"\nreturn \"Beep beep boop\" if you pass in a number\nreturn \"I'm sorry, I'm still learning about feelings!\" if you pass in anything else\n\nLogical Operators\nThere are three logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT).\nThey let you write expressions that evaluate to a boolean value.\nSuppose you want to test if a number is bigger than 3 and smaller than 10. We can write this, using different logical operators.\nlet num = 10;\n\nfunction satisfiesRequirements(num) {\n  if (num > 3 && num \nWe can test expressions with logical operators in a node console too.\nExercise (5 mins)\nType the following expressions into your node REPL and note the output. Anything you didn't expect?\n\nlet num = 10\nnum > 5 && num \nnum \nfalse || true\n!true\nlet greaterThan5 = num > 5\n!greaterThan5\n!(num === 10)\n\nExercise (15 mins)\nIn pairs, write a function that checks a username is of an acceptable format for a user type. The function must:\n\ntake two parameters: one for the username and one for the user type\nif the username starts with a capital letter and has length between 5 and 10 characters long, it must return \"Username valid\"; otherwise, it must return \"Username invalid\"\nif the user type is an admin or a manager, all usernames must return \"Username valid\"\n\nLoops\nWhen we're writing programs, we often find that we want to repeat a bit of code over and over, or repeat it but change something about it each time. To save ourselves from writing all that code, we can use a loop. JavaScript has two kinds of loops, a while loop and a for loop.\nwhile loop\nA while loop is a way to repeat code until some condition is evaluated to false. For example:\nlet i = 0;\nwhile (i \nNotice the line i++ - this is the same as saying i = i + 1 It does exactly the same thing but it is just more convenient to write.\nIt's important that the condition inside the parenthesis becomes false at some point - otherwise, we'll have what's known as an infinite loop!\nExercise (10 minutes)\nWrite a function that:\n\nTakes one number n as a parameter\nAdds all numbers from 0 to n. For example, if the input is 3, the output should be 0 + 1 + 2 + 3\nYou should use a while loop\n\nfor loop\nThe for loop is similar to a while loop, but with a more specialized syntax. Programmers invented the for loop when they realized they were always doing the same three things: creating loop counter variables (like i above), incrementing them by some amount, and checking that they're less than a value.\nThe for loop syntax has special places for each of those three things. Here's the same loop as the first while loop above, as a for loop:\n\nfor (let i = 0; i \nExercise (10 minutes)\nWrite a function, similar to the last exercise, that:\n\nTakes one number n as a parameter\nAdds all numbers from 0 to n. For example, if the input is 3, the output should be 0 + 1 + 2 + 3\nYou should use an for loop\n\nArrays\nIf you ever find yourself writing code like this...\nconst mentor1 = \"Daniel\";\nconst mentor2 = \"Irina\";\nconst mentor3 = \"Rares\";\n\n...then it's probably time to use an array!\nArrays are data structures that hold a list of values. We call these values the elements of the array.\nconst mentors = [\"Daniel\", \"Irina\", \"Rares\"];\n\nArrays can hold any type of value (although almost always you only have one data type per array).\nconst testScores = [16, 49, 85];\nconst grades = [\"F\", \"D\", \"A\"];\nconst greetings = [\"Hello, how are you?\", \"Hi! Nice to meet you!\"];\n\nYou can access elements in an array using the index of an element with bracket notation\n&#x1F514; Remember: All arrays start at position 0! To access the first element in an array, you need to access index 0, the second element at 1, the fifth at 4 and so forth. This is called zero-based indexed arrays. There are some very intense reasons for this, but most people just accept it and move on.\nconst students = [\"Ahmed\", \"Maria\", \"Atanas\", \"Nahidul\", \"Jack\"];\n\nstudents[0]; // \"Ahmed\"\nstudents[3]; // \"Nahidul\"\n\nYou can also assign new values to parts of an array:\nconst students = [\"Ahmed\", \"Maria\", \"Atanas\", \"Nahidul\", \"Jack\"];\n\nstudents[2] = \"Bianca\";\n\nconsole.log(students); // [\"Ahmed\", \"Maria\", \"Bianca\", \"Nahidul\", \"Jack\"]\n\nExercise (5 mins)\nIn the node REPL, enter the following array:\n> const fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'strawberry', 'kiwi', 'fig', 'orange'];\n\nNow, using the correct indexes, get the following values from the array:\n\nstrawberry\nkiwi\norange\nbanana\n\nThen, replace 'apple' with 'raspberry', and replace 'fig' with 'pineapple'.\nExercise (5 mins)\nComplete this function so that, if the second index in the array contains the name \"Amy\", it returns \"Second index matched!\"\nfunction secondMatchesAmy(array) {\n  if ( ) {\n    return \"Second index matched!\";\n  }\n  return \"Second index not matched\";\n}\n\nUsing for loops with arrays\nWe can use the power of loops to run some code for each element in our array.\nWhen we do this say we iterate over an array.\nconst daysOfWeek = [\n  \"Monday\",\n  \"Tuesday\",\n  \"Wednesday\",\n  \"Thursday\",\n  \"Friday\",\n  \"Saturday\",\n  \"Sunday\",\n];\n\nfor (let i = 0; i \nExercise (10 mins)\nWrite a function which takes your students array as an input. In the function, use a for loop to iterate over the array and print the name of each student to the console.\nExercise - extra credit (20 mins)\nIn pairs, write a function which squares all numbers in an array and returns the array of squared numbers.\nWrite a second function which takes an input of arrays and only returns an array of even numbers.\nHow can you combine the two functions to return an array of even and squared numbers?\nExtra exercises\nPlaying computer I\n\nWorking in pairs or groups, you have to predict the output of this program without executing it.\nWhat is printed to the console?\nHave you learned anything new during this exercise?\n\nconst daysOfWeek = [\n  \"Monday\",\n  \"Tuesday\",\n  \"Wednesday\",\n  \"Thursday\",\n  \"Friday\",\n  \"Saturday\",\n  \"Sunday\",\n];\n\nfunction workingDay(day) {\n  return day + \" is a working day\";\n}\n\nfunction weekendDay(day) {\n  return day + \" is at the weekend!\";\n}\n\nfor (let i = 0; i \nPlaying computer II\n\nWorking in pairs or groups, you have to predict the output of this program without executing it.\nWhat is printed to the console?\nHave you learned anything new during this exercise?\n\nconst a = 4;\nconst b = 8;\n\nconst multiplyNumbers = function (a, b) {\n  return a * b;\n};\n\nconst addNumbers = function (a, b, c) {\n  return a + b + c;\n};\n\nfor (let i = 0; i \nPlaying computer III\n\nAgain, working in pairs or groups, you have to predict the output of this program without executing it.\nWhat is printed to the console?\nWhat was difficult about this exercise?\nHave you learned anything new?\n\nlet x = 2;\nlet y = 4;\nlet a = 2;\nlet b = 20;\n\nconst f1 = function (a, b) {\n  return a * b;\n};\n\nconst f2 = function (a, b, c) {\n  return a + b + c;\n};\n\nconsole.log(x);\nx = 3;\ny = f1(x, 2);\nconsole.log(y);\n\nfor (let i = 0; i \nGlossary\n\nAssert: to determine whether something is true or not true, more precisely false\nDuplicate: exact copies of something (e.g. two or more files, numbers, directory can be exactly the same)\nIndex: numbers that let you know an item's position inside an array\nElement: another name for an item in an array\nIterate: to repeat some code multiple times, as we do when we use a loop\nREPL: (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) an interactive way to execute code you write inside the console\nZero-based Index: an array starting at 0 and not at 1\n\nFor words like Terminal, Primitive Types please see Glossary: JavaScript Core I - 2\nHomework\nFork the JavaScript-Core-1-Homework repo repo and solve all exercises in the week-2/mandatory.

Don't worry if not! Here's an example to jog your memory:\n$ node\n> let name = \"Daniel\";\nundefined\n> name.toLowerCase()\ndaniel\n\nArrays also have several methods that you can use.\n.sort()\nAn array method that sorts the values in an array into ascending alphabetical or numerical order.\nconst unorderedLetters = [\"z\", \"v\", \"b\", \"f\", \"g\"];\nconst orderedLetters = unorderedLetters.sort();\n\nconst unorderedNumbers = [8, 5, 1, 4, 2];\nconst orderedNumbers = unorderedNumbers.sort();\n\nconsole.log(orderedLetters); // logs [ 'b', 'f', 'g', 'v', 'z' ]\nconsole.log(unorderedLetters); // logs [ 'b', 'f', 'g', 'v', 'z' ]\n\nconsole.log(orderedNumbers); // logs [ 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 ]\nconsole.log(unorderedNumbers); // logs [ 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 ]\n\n\nWhen you call this array method it uses the array on the left side of the dot as an input, and it sorts that array also returning it. Note how both ordered and unordered arrays are sorted now!\n\n.concat()\nAdds (or concatenates) another value or array to the array.\n$ node\n> let arr = [1, 2, 3];\nundefined\n> arr.concat(4)\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n> arr\n[1, 2, 3]\n\nDid you notice how calling the concat method did not change arr? This is because concat, like most array methods, returns a new array, it does not alter the one you called the method on.\nIf you want to use the array returned by calling .concat() you should store it in a new variable.\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3];\nconst newArr = arr.concat(4);\n\nconsole.log(newArr); // logs [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n.slice()\nReturns a slice of the array.\nYou can tell .slice() where you want the slice to begin and end by passing it two parameters.\n$ node\n> let arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\nundefined\n> arr.slice(0, 2)\n[0, 1]\n> [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"].slice(1, 2)\n['b']\n\n.includes()\nReturns true if a value is in the array.\nconst mentors = [\"Daniel\", \"Irini\", \"Ashleigh\", \"Rob\", \"Etzali\"];\n\nfunction isAMentor(name) {\n  return mentors.includes(name);\n}\n\nconsole.log(\"Is Rukmuni a mentor?\");\nconsole.log(isAMentor(\"Rukmini\")); // logs false\n\n.join()\nReturns all the array values joined together in a string. By default, this method takes no parameters and then the elements are divided with a comma ,. If you provide it with a string parameter though, then it becomes the divider of the elements, like the example below:\n$ node\n> [\"H\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"].join();\n'H,e,l,l,o'\n> [\"H\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"].join(\"--\");\n'H--e--l--l--o'\n\nThere is a string method .split(). In an interactive console try using the string .split() method and the array .join(). How could they work together?\nExercise (10 minutes)\n\nUse the array of the people from your table\nCombine it with another array filled with the names from another table\nconsole.log the names in alphabetical order\nCreate a new value with the 2nd, 3rd and 4th people in it\nCreate a function that takes a name and an array of names and returns a string. If the name is not in an array, it should return  is not sitting at the table with . If the name is in the array, it should return  is sitting at the table with .\n\nArray map\nImagine you have an array of names...\nconst mentors = [\"Daniel \", \"irina \", \" Gordon\", \"ashleigh \"];\n\nYou notice that the names are not formatted consistently. To fix the array you decide you need to trim whitespace and convert to lowercase. How do you do that for every value in the array?\nWe can write a function that changes one name:\nfunction tidy(name) {\n  return name.trim().toLowerCase();\n}\n\nAll you need to run every name in the array through this function and update the array values. Thankfully there is an array method that does just this!\n.map()\nRuns every item in the array through a function and returns a new array with the values returned by the function.\nHave a look at this other example:\nfunction double(number) {\n  return number * 2;\n}\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map(double);\n\nThe map() method runs the function we provided (double) on each item in the array and uses the return values to create a new array. In the example numbersDoubled is a new array containing [2, 4, 6].\nCallback functions\nA function that we provide to a method is commonly called a callback function. The term highlights that although we provide the double function, the .map() method calls it. (Notice how we never write double() to call the function).\nWe'll see callback functions used a lot more in the coming weeks.\nOften, when a function is only needed for a map operation, developers will declare the callback function inside of the method call. Let's try copying and pasting the function declaration inside of the .map() method call.\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map(function double(number) {\n  return number * 2;\n});\n\nWe can make this shorter by removing the function name to declare an anonymous function. We can do this because we are not using the function anywhere else in the code, so we do not need the function name to reference it.\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map(function (number) {\n  return number * 2;\n});\n\nWe can make this code even shorter still. In the latest versions of JavaScript a way of declaring functions was introduced called arrow functions.\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map((number) => {\n  return number * 2;\n});\n\nThe arrow function syntax lets you declare a function without the function keyword. (There are some other subtle differences between arrow functions and regular functions that you will learn about at a much later stage).\nThere is one last thing you can do to make your code shorter. If you remove the braces ({}) from an arrow function, the body of the function will be returned without needing to write the return keyword.\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);\n\nIn the example above, the expression number * 2 is automatically returned because it comes directly after the => arrow (instead of coming after curly braces). This is called an implicit return.\nExercise (10 minutes)\nI have a function defined below as:\nfunction abracaFunction(yourFunc) {\n  console.log(\n    \"I am abracaFunction! Watch as I mutate an array of strings to your heart's content!\"\n  );\n  const abracaArray = [\n    \"James\",\n    \"Elamin\",\n    \"Ismael\",\n    \"Sanyia\",\n    \"Chris\",\n    \"Antigoni\",\n  ];\n\n  const abracaOutput = yourFunc(abracaArray);\n\n  return abracaOutput;\n}\n\nThis function does not need to be modified. Can you pass in a callback function which will mutate abracaArray such that it:\n\nUpper cases all letters in the array\n\nExercise - extra credit\nModify your callback function from the previous exercise so that it also:\n\nSorts abracaArray in alphabetical order\n\nArray forEach\nThe .forEach() method is similar to .map() except it does not return a new array. Therefore .forEach() is only useful if you want to perform side effects.\nSide effects\nGenerally, functions should take an input and return an output (based on that input), and not do anything else.\nWhen functions meet this criteria they can be called pure functions.\nA pure function does not:\n\naccess any data unless it was passed in as a parameter\nchange data declared outside the function\ninteracts with anything outside of the function (e.g. logs a message to the console, shows a message on a website, saves data to disk)\n\nThese are all example of side effects. Of course, from time to time, we will need to perform side effects, but we should try to avoid side effects inside of functions and only have them when absolutely necessary.\n.forEach()\nSay we want to log to the console a list of names.\nconst names = [\"Daniel\", \"mozafar\", \"irina\"];\n\nWe can use .forEach() to go through the array, item by item, and call a function we provide.\nnames.forEach(function (name, index) {\n  console.log(index + \": \" + name);\n});\n\nExercise (10 minutes)\n\nCreate a function that takes a birthYear, and returns the age of someone\nYou are given an array with year that 7 people were born, [1964, 2008, 1999, 2005, 1978, 1985, 1919]. Take this array and create another array containing their ages.\nconsole.log the birth years array\n\nExercise (5 minutes)\nYou can drive in the UK at the age of 17.\n\nWrite another function that takes a birth year and returns a string Born in {year} can drive or Born in {year} can drive in {x} years\nUse the array of birth years, [ 1964, 2008, 1999, 2005, 1978, 1985, 1919 ], to get an array of strings saying if these people can drive\nconsole.log the answers\n\nArray filter\nImagine you have an array of students' test scores:\nconst testScores = [90, 50, 100, 66, 25, 80, 81];\n\nYou want to show only the test scores that are higher than 80. How do you do that for every value in the array?\nWe can write a function that checks if one score is greater than 80:\nfunction isHighScore(score) {\n  return score > 80;\n}\n\nTo find out which scores were greater than 80, you'd have to run this function against every score in the array, and push the 80+ scores into a new array. Thankfully there is an array method that does just this!\n.filter()\nRuns every item in the array through a condition that we set, and returns a new array with the values that match the condition.\nconst highTestScores = testScores.filter(isHighScore);\n\nconsole.log(highTestScores); // logs [90, 100, 81]\n\nExercise (10 mins)\nCreate a function which:\n\nTakes an array of birthYears\nUses console.log to print the message These are the birth years of people who can drive: \nReturns an array of people who can drive (remember, you can drive if you are 17 years or older)\n\nArray find\nImagine you have an array of names:\nconst names = [\"Daniel\", \"James\", \"Irina\", \"Mozafar\", \"Ashleigh\"];\n\nHow would you find the first name that's longer than 6 characters?\nYou can write a predicate function that checks if a string is longer than 6 characters:\nfunction isLongName(name) {\n  return name.length > 6;\n}\n\nTo find the first item that satisfies the predicate you would have to go through each array item, and pass it into isLongName. Once it returns true, we can stop going through the array and grab the item that passed the predicate's test. Sounds complicated! Thankfully there is an array method that does just this!\n.find()\nSearches through the array and returns the value of the first item that satisfies a predicate function.\nconst longName = names.find(isLongName);\n\nconsole.log(longName); // logs Mozafar\n\nExercise (10 mins)\nCreate a function which:\n\nTakes an array of names\nLooks to see if your name is in the array\nIf it is, return Found me!; if not, return Haven't found me :(\n\nChaining\nNotice how we were able to write one method after another e.g. names.map(formatName).forEach(log)? This is called method chaining.\nYou can call .forEach() after .map() because .map() returns a new array.\nConsider this code:\nfunction formatName(name) {\n  return name.split(\"\")[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1);\n}\n\nfunction log(name, index) {\n  console.log(index + \": \" + name);\n}\n\nconst namesFormatted = names.map(formatName);\nnamesFormatted.forEach(log);\n\nIt can be written more simply (without assigning the array returned from .map() to a variable):\nnames.map(formatName).forEach(log);\n\nBe careful though! You can not call .map() after .forEach.\nnames.forEach(log).map(formatName); // ERROR\n\nThis code does not work because forEach() does not return a new array (it returns undefined). The code is therefore attempting to call .map() on undefined, and undefined does not have a .map() method.\nExercise (15 minutes)\nCreate a function which accepts an array of \"messy\" strings. Example:\n[\n  100,\n  \"iSMael\",\n  55,\n  45,\n  \"sANyiA\",\n  66,\n  \"JaMEs\",\n  \"eLAmIn\",\n  23,\n  \"IsMael\",\n  67,\n  19,\n  \"ElaMIN\",\n];\n\nThis function should:\n\nRemove all non-string entries\nChange the strings to upper case, and add an exclamation mark to the end\n\nIf you're using the above example, you should expect to return an array with 2x ELAMIN!, 1x SANYIA!, 2x ISMAEL! and 1x JAMES!.\nHomework\nFork the JavaScript-Core-1-Homework repo repo and solve all exercises in the week-3/mandatory.

Actual result: ${getCheapestAddress(\n    parkAvenueHouse,\n    kinningParkHouse\n  )}`\n);\n\nObject Methods\nBesides having specific properties, objects in the real world can also do things. For example, a computer can display something on the screen, a person can say their names etc... In Javascript, we do this using 'methods'. A method is a function attached to a particular object. You have already used some predefined methods before, for example toUpperCase() on a string or filter() on an array.\nlet athlete = {\n  name: \"Usain Bolt\",\n  goldMedals: 25,\n  sayHi: function () {\n    return \"Hi everybody!\";\n  },\n};\n\nHow do we call this method?\nathlete.sayHi(); // returns \"Hi everybody!\"\n\nExercise\n/*\n\nA person named Alice is defined below.\n  1. Add a method \"greet\" so this person can say hello.\n  2. Add a method \"sayName\" so this person can say their own name.\n\n*/\n\nlet person = {\n  name: \"Alice\",\n  age: 25,\n};\n\n/*\nDO NOT EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE\n*/\n\nconsole.log(\n  `Expected result: Hello everybody. Actual result: ${person.greet()}`\n);\nconsole.log(\n  `Expected result: 'My name is Alice'. Actual result: ${person.sayName()}`\n);\n\nArrays of objects\nIn the past weeks, you've learned about using arrays of numbers, arrays of string etc... In the following, we will learn how to use arrays of objects.\nlet kitten1 = {\n  name: \"Fluffy\",\n  weeksOld: 2,\n};\n\nlet kitten2 = {\n  name: \"Megatron\",\n  weeksOld: 1,\n};\n\nlet kitten3 = {\n  name: \"Billy\",\n  weeksOld: 5,\n};\n\nlet kittens = [kitten1, kitten2, kitten3];\n\nYou can also use all the functions for arrays that you learned before: find, some, every, filter, map, forEach... As an example, we want to filter all the kittens who are less than 3 weeks old:\nfunction isYoungerThan3Weeks(kitten) {\n  return kitten.weeksOld \nWhat if we want to get an array of all the kitties names?\nfunction getName(kitten) {\n  return kitten.name;\n}\n\nkittens.map(getName); // returns [\"Fluffy\", \"Megatron\", \"Billy\"]\n\nExercise (1)\n/*\n1) Define an array containing the 3 persons defined below.\n2) Return an array of the person names (hint: use map).\n3) Filter the persons to return an array with the person younger than 28 years old (hint: use filter).\n*/\n\nlet person1 = {\n    name: \"Alice\",\n    age: 25\n};\n\nlet person2 = {\n    name: \"Bob\",\n    age: 30\n};\n\nlet person3 = {\n    name: \"John\",\n    age: 20\n};\n\n/*\nDO NOT EDIT ANYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE\nWRITE YOUR CODE BELOW\n*/\n\n\nlet persons = // Complete here\n\nlet personNames = // Complete here\n\nlet personsYoungerThan28YearsOld = // Complete here\n\n\n/*\nDO NOT EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE\n*/\n\nconsole.log(\"Question 1: array defined with 3 persons -> \",\n    (persons[0] === person1 && persons[1] === person2 && persons[2] === person3) ?

Someone else created these methods, and we can use them in our code.\nLike arrays, objects have built-in methods that can help us. In this lesson, we will learn about Object.keys() and Object.values().\nObject.keys()\nThis method goes into our object, and returns the object property names as an array.\nHere is an example output for using .keys():\nlet footballClubs = {\n  chelsea_fc: \"England\",\n  fc_barcelona: \"Spain\",\n  ac_milan: \"Italy\",\n};\n\nconsole.log(Object.keys(footballClubs));\n// prints [ 'chelsea_fc', 'fc_barcelona', 'ac_milan' ]\n\nObject.values()\nThis method goes into our object, and returns the values of every property as an array.\nHere is an example output for using .values():\nlet footballClubs = {\n  chelsea_fc: \"England\",\n  fc_barcelona: \"Spain\",\n  ac_milan: \"Italy\",\n};\n\nconsole.log(Object.values(footballClubs));\n// prints [ 'England', 'Spain', 'Italy' ]\n\nExercise (1)\n/*\n\nReturn the keys and values of the following object\n\n*/\n\nlet capitalCities = {\n  scotland: 'Edinburgh',\n  kenya: 'Nairobi',\n  australia: 'Canberra',\n  canada: 'Ottawa'\n};\n\nlet falafelWrap = {\n  calories: 550,\n  secretIngredient: \"falafels\",\n  isVeggie: true\n};\n\n// ONLY EDIT BELOW HERE\n\nlet capitalCitiesKeys = ;\nlet falafelWrapKeys = ;\nlet capitalCitiesValues = ;\nlet falafelWrapValues = ;\n\n// ONLY EDIT ABOVE HERE\n\nconsole.log(capitalCitiesKeys);\n// prints [ 'scotland', 'kenya', 'australia', 'canada' ]\n\nconsole.log(falafelWrapKeys)\n// prints ['calories', 'secretIngredient', 'isVeggie']\n\nconsole.log(capitalCitiesValues);\n// prints [ 'Edinburgh', 'Nairobi', 'Canberra', 'Ottawa' ]\n\nconsole.log(falafelWrapValues)\n// prints [550, 'falafels', true]\n\nExercise (2)\n/*\n\nYou have an object of mentors and their ages below, but the keys are inconsistent. JOSH and JAMIE are uppercase, while james and Mozafar are not. You want to return an array of mentors with the names in uppercase.\n\nYou're going to have to used what we learned at the start of this lesson, and some other JavaScript methods to accomplish this task.\n\n*/\n\nlet mentorsAges = {\n  james: 29,\n  JOSH: 35,\n  JAMIE: 25,\n  Mozafar: 30\n};\n\n// ONLY EDIT BELOW THIS LINE\n\nlet mentorsNames = ;\n\nlet mentorsNamedUppercased = ;\n\n// ONLY EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE\n\nconsole.log(mentorsNamedUppercased);\n// prints [ 'JAMES', 'JOSH', 'JAMIE', 'MOZAFAR' ]\n\nExercise (3)\n/*\n\nObjects very often contain other objects.\n\nThis exercise will give you practice in getting the keys of objects inside other objects.\n\nUse the provided console.log statements below and follow the instructions above them.\n\n*/\n\nlet storeBranches = {\n  glasgow: {\n    manager: \"Andrew\",\n    assistant: \"Laura\",\n    interns: {\n      head_intern: \"Mozafar\",\n      intern: \"James\",\n    },\n  },\n\n  edinburgh: {\n    director: \"Kelly\",\n    manager: \"Sally\",\n    assistant: \"Derek\",\n    interns: {\n      head_intern: \"John\",\n      intern: \"Sarah\",\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n// ONLY EDIT BELOW THIS LINE\n\n// # 1\n// prints [ 'glasgow', 'edinburgh' ]\nconsole.log();\n\n// # 2\n// prints [ 'manager', 'assistant', 'interns' ]\nconsole.log();\n\n// # 3\n// prints [ 'head_intern', 'intern' ]\nconsole.log();\n\n// ONLY EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE\n\nLoop through an Object\nOnce in a while it will be required to loop through objects.\nSince we started JavaScript, we have used console.log to print things to our console.\nOnce you create an array of the object's keys or values using the Object.keys, Object.values methods, you can loop through it as if it was a normal array using array methods like forEach.\nExample:\nconst flowers = {\n  tulip: 20,\n  rose: 10,\n  lily: 15,\n};\n\n// Looping through the array created from Object.keys\nconst flowerKeys = Object.keys(flowers);\n\nflowerKeys.forEach((key) => {\n  console.log(`${key}: ${flowers[key]}`);\n});\n\n// Prints\n// tulip: 20\n// rose: 10\n// lily: 15\n\nExercise (1)\n// You are given an object of student names and grades\n// Loop through all the students' grades and console log the name and grade of the ones with grade more than 18\n// Try to use both methods shown above to achieve this\n\nconst studentGrades = {\n  tom: 20,\n  george: 17,\n  abdul: 19,\n};\n\n// Prints\n// TOM - 20\n// ABDUL - 19\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo contains few challenges - solve all the pending exercises in week-4 and week-4-practise.\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-2/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-2/lesson.html","title":"Week 2 - JS in the Browser","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core II - Week 2\n\nTeaching this lesson?\nRead the Mentors Notes here\n\nContents\n\nJS in the Browser\nThe DOM\nAccess DOM elements\nPreparation for exercises\nExercise (1)\n\n\nAttach events to DOM elements\nExercise (2)\nExercise (3)\n\n\nCreate DOM elements\nExercise (4)\n\n\nManipulate DOM elements\nExercise (5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson students should be able to:\n\nDefine what the DOM is and what it does\nUse query selectors to retrieve elements from the DOM\nUse event listeners to respond to events that happen on the DOM\nCreate DOM elements using JavaScript and add them to the DOM\nManipulate DOM elements using JavaScript to change their properties\n\n\n\nPlease make sure you're working on the js-exercises repo Week 5 during this class.\n\nJS in the Browser\nUp until now we've been using console.log to see the results of our code running, because it allows us to focus on writing code and seeing the results instantly. But JavaScript was not meant to be run in console.log: it was meant to make web pages dynamic.\nLots of websites are powered by JavaScript today, and some (like Facebook) cannot function at all without it: it's become that important to the look and feel of the website.\nThe DOM\nYour webpages are made up of a bunch of HTML elements, nested within each other (parents and children). But JavaScript doesn't know about any of that.\nThankfully, in JavaScript we have access to this \"DOM\" object (Document Object Model) which is actually a representation of our webpage that JavaScript can work with.\nHere are two examples, HTML and then JavaScript, of how the DOM might look like:\n\n  \n    Welcome!\n    Hello world!\n  \n\n\nlet document = {\n  body: {\n    h1: \"Welcome\",\n    p: \"Hello world!\",\n  },\n};\n\nThis is how we would represent the document hierarchy above as a tree of nodes:\n\nAccess DOM elements\nThe DOM offers a lot of useful functions we can use to find elements on the page. Here are some we'll be using today:\ndocument.querySelector(\"#mainHeader\");\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"p\");\n\nBoth .querySelector and querySelectorAll accept a CSS selector as an input.\n.querySelector selects only the first element it finds, querySelectorAll selects all elements (it returns an array).\nPreparation for exercises\n\n\nLet's work on the code provided here:\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises/tree/master/week-5/InClass/A-dom-manipulation\n\nOpen \"A-dom-manipulation\" project in VS code\nYou will have to work on the exercise.js file for today's homework\nView your changes by\nusing vscode-live-server plugin to get live updates of your changes.\nInstall the plugin\nRight click on index.html and select \"Open with Live Server\"\n\n\nor just open the index.html on your browser and refresh every time you change your code\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise (1)\n/*\nTask 1\n=======\nWrite JavaScript below that logs:\n    1. all the \"p\" element nodes of the document,\n    --> should log a list of nodes with a length of 6\n\n    2. the first div element node\n    --> should log the \".site-header\" node\n\n    3. the element with id \"jumbotron-text\"\n    --> should log the \"#jumbotron-text\" node\n\n    4. all the \"p\" elements contained inside  the .primary-content element node\n    --> should log a list of nodes with a length of 3\n\n*/\n\nAttach events to DOM elements\nOnce you retrieve an element using .querySelector, you can attach an event to it. An event is any action that can be performed on that element. For now, we will just use the click event:\nlet myButton = document.querySelector(\"#myButton\");\nmyButton.addEventListener(\"click\", alertSomething);\n\nfunction alertSomething() {\n  alert(\"Something\");\n}\n\nYou will notice in the example that we passed a second argument to addEventListener. That second argument is the function that we want to invoke when that event has happened.\nExercise (2)\n/*\nTask 2\n======\n\nWhen a user clicks the \"ALERT\" button, an alert box should pop up with the text \"Thanks for visiting Bikes for Refugees!\"\n*/\n\nThe elements returned by document.querySelector have the same properties as a normal HTML element: for example, you can get access to their css styles.\nlet myElement = document.querySelector(\"#myElement\");\nmyElement.style.backgroundColor = \"red\";\n\nExercise (3)\n/*\nTask 3\n=======\n\nWrite JavaScript below that changes the background colour of the page when the \"Change colour\" button is clicked.\n*/\n\nCreate DOM elements\nUsing the document, you can also create new elements. These elements will not appear until you append them as a child of another element though:\nlet paragraph = document.createElement(\"p\"); // here we're just creating it, element is not visible yet\nmyElement.appendChild(paragraph); // now the element is added to our view, but it's empty\n\ndocument.createElement accepts as an input any element type. So for example document.createElement(\"article\") will create a new article element.\nExercise (4)\n/*\nTask 4\n======\n\nWhen a user clicks the \"Add some text\" button, a new paragraph should be added below the buttons that says \"Read more below.\"\n*/\n\nManipulate DOM elements\nYou can then change the text displayed inside elements using the innerText property:\nparagraph.innerText = \"How are you?\"; // now we can see the text displaying on the screen\n\nWe've been using document.querySelector to retrieve a single element.\nTo retrieve an array of multiple elements (that match a specific class name for example, or a specific tag) we use document.querySelectorAll.\n//change the background of all the paragraph items on our page\nlet paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll(\"p\");\nfor (let i = 0; i \nWe've learned that style and innerText are properties of DOM elements. Image tags can also have width and height.\nWhile it's really easy to change styles directly on elements using the style property, it is not usually a good idea to mix JavaScript and CSS (see separation of concerns in the first lesson). To solve this, we can use the className property to set the class for an element instead of changing its styles directly:\n//before: \nlet container = document.querySelector(\"#myContainer\");\ncontainer.className = \"largeBlock\";\n//after: \n\nTo get the text from an Input field:\nlet updateTitleBtn = document.querySelector(\"#updateTitleBtn\");\n\nupdateTitleBtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n  let inputBox = document.querySelector(\"#titleInput\");\n  let title = inputBox.value;\n\n  let titleElement = document.querySelector(\"#lessonTitle\");\n  titleElement.innerText = title;\n  inputBox.value = title;\n});\n\nThe above waits for click on a button. When the button is clicked, it gets the input box element (inputBox variable).\nTo get the entered text from it, we use the value property: let title = inputBox.value.\nExercise (5)\n/*\nTask 5\n======\n\nWhen the \"Larger links!\" button is clicked, the text of all links on the page should increase.\n*/\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo contains few challenges - solve all the pending exercises in week-5.\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-3/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-3/lesson.html","title":"Week 3 - Asynchronous and The Web","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core II - Week 3\n\nTeaching this lesson?\nRead the Mentors Notes here\n\nContents\n\nSynchronous and Asynchronous programming\nA real life example\nA Javascript example\nCallbacks\nExercise (1)\n\n\n\n\nHow does the web work?\nClient/Server architecture\nHTTP Requests\nExercise (2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson students should be able to:\n\nDefine the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code\nDescribe why writing asynchronous code is important when working with the internet\nWrite code that is able to pass a function to another function as a parameter and run it\nUse callbacks to run code at some point in the future\nDefine a client's and server's role in the client/server architecture\nDescribe the difference between a GET and POST request\nExplain how resources are loaded on the internet using GET and POST\nList the steps that a browser does when loading a website from the internet\n\n\nSynchronous and Asynchronous programming\nIn a synchronous programming model, tasks run one at a time. When a long running action starts, the program waits for it to finish and return the result before it moves to the next action.\nAsynchronous programming allows multiple actions to happen at the same time. When a long running action starts, the program can continue to run. When the action finishes the program will get notified and get access to the result returned.\n\nA real life example\nAn example of this in real life, are phone calls and text messages.\n\nPhone calls are synchronous because you can't (really) do anything while the\nother person is speaking. You are always waiting for your turn to respond\nText messages are asynchronous. When you send a text, you can go away and do\nsomething else, until the other person responds.\n\nA Javascript example\n//synchronous\nconsole.log(\"First action\");\nconsole.log(\"Second action\");\nconsole.log(\"Third action\");\n\n//asynchronous\nconsole.log(\"First action\");\nsetTimeout(function () {\n  console.log(\"Second action\");\n}, 1000);\nconsole.log(\"Third action\");\n\nExercise (1)\nconst greekGods = [\n  \"Aphrodite\",\n  \"Ares\",\n  \"Artemis\",\n  \"Athena\",\n  \"Poseidon\",\n  \"Zeus\",\n];\n\n// before running the code in your browser, discuss the expected order of each loop\n\n// synchronous - loop through the array of greek gods and print the index numbers and values to the console, e.g. '1. Ares'\n\n// asynchronous - same as before but the index and the value of the god at position 2 in array should be printed after 2 seconds. Use: setTimeout()\n\nCallbacks\nWe have already seen callback functions - in the Array methods forEach, map, filter etc. They are functions that are passed as parameter to another function.\nIn order to achieve asynchronicity, callbacks can be passed on functions that perform a slow action. By doing so, the callback function can be called with the result.\nThis allows you to run some other code while you're waiting for something to finish.\nfunction finished() {\n  console.log(\"The task has finished\");\n}\n\nfunction thingThatTakesALongTime(callbackFunction) {\n  //... Task that takes a long time to complete\n\n  callbackFunction(); // This is where the 'console.log' happens\n}\n\n// Pass the function to 'thingThatTakesALongTime' just like a normal variable\nthingThatTakesALongTime(finished);\n\nA simple example of an asynchronous function is setTimeout. This allows you to run a function after a given time period. The first argument is the function you want to run, the second argument is the delay (in milliseconds)\n// Separate function definition\nfunction myCallbackFunction() {\n  console.log(\"Hello world!\");\n}\nsetTimeout(myCallbackFunction, 1000);\n\n// Inline function\nsetTimeout(function () {\n  console.log(\"Hello world!\");\n}, 500);\n\nNow let's use a timeout and a callback function together:\nfunction mainFunction(callback) {\n  console.log(\"Starting!\");\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    callback();\n  }, 1000);\n  console.log(\"Continuing!\");\n}\nfunction myCallbackFunction() {\n  console.log(\"Finished!\");\n}\nmainFunction(myCallbackFunction);\n\nExercise (2)\n\n\nUsing setTimeout, change the background colour of the page after 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds).\nUpdate your code to make the colour change every 5 seconds to something different. Hint: try searching for setInterval.\n\n\nComplete the exercises in this CodePen\n\nExercise (3)\n\nComplete the exercises in this CodePen\n\nYou are given a list of movie objects to work with\nUse setTimeout to imitate that some actions take time\nRemember that setTimeout behaves asynchronously\n\nAll set, go! Work on the tasks given. Your result html will look like this:\n\n\nHow does the web work?\nClient/Server architecture\n\nA Client is the typical web user's internet-connected devices and apps. This can be a web browser, a Slack app, your phone, etc.\nA Server is a computer or program that manages access to resources such as webpages, sites, or apps.\nThere are database servers, mail servers, game servers, etc. The vast majority of these servers are accessed over the internet. They can take the form of industrial server farms that provide a service to millions of users (used by Facebook, Google, etc.), to personal servers for storing your files.\nThe server communicates with clients.\nClient–server systems use the request–response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgement.\n\nHTTP Requests\nA server stores the data, and the client (other programs or computers) requests data or sends some of its own. But how do they talk to each other?\nFor the client and the server to communicate they need an established language (a protocol). Which is what HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is for. It defines the methods you can use to communicate with a server and indicate your desired actions on the resources of the server.\nThere are two main types of requests: GET and POST.\n\n\n\nRequest type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGET\nAsk for a specified resource (e.g. show me that photo)\n\n\nPOST\nSend content to the server (e.g. post a photo)\n\n\n\nHTTP is the language of the internet. In our case we're using Javascript, but you can send HTTP requests with other languages as well.\nThe Network Tab\nThe network tab is a useful tool that helps us understand how content is loaded on a website.\nYou can view it by Right Click > Inspect > Network.\nTake some time to look at the network tab when we open this lesson/\nThe important parts of the the Network Tab are:\n\nNetwork Log\nTimeline View\nResource Details\n\nExercise - GET Requests\n\nLet's take a look at GET requests in the Browser.\nLook at this repository here:\n\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Network-Tab-Example\n\nIn your groups, you should try to work out what you expect to see in the Network tab when we look at it. You should create a list of the requests that will be made in this format.\nYou are not allowed to open the website in a browser\ne.g.\n\nGET index.html\nGET format.de\nGET otherfile.se\n...\n\nWhen you have completed the list you should share it on Slack\nYou can see the website online here\n\nhttps://codeyourfuture.github.io/Network-Tab-Example/\n\nExtra\nGo to your favorite website and take a look at the Network tab. Can you work out what each (or any) of the requests are doing?\nWarning! There will be a lot of requests made on complicated websites.\n\nExercise - POST Requests\n\nLet's take a look at POST requests in the Browser.\nYou can see the website online here\n\nhttps://codeyourfuture.github.io/Network-Tab-Example/\n\nAt the bottom of the page you will see a series of buttons. When you click a button on the website it will send a POST request to a server.\n\nUsing only the Network tab work out which button is sending a post request.\nWhat is in the body of the post request?\n\nExtra\n\nDid the POST request succeed?\nUsing the Details Panel, can you work out why?\n\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo contains few challenges - solve all the pending exercises in week-6.\n\nJavaScript 2 Quiz\nAn optional quiz can be found here which can be used to test students understanding.

Debugging\nVocabulary\n\nSyntax & Syntactical\nBug\nError\n\nWhy is Debugging Important?\nWhen are projects are very small it's easy to see the problems and when something does break it's not to much of an issue. This isn't true when we start working on larger projects.\nThe code that we write has real world uses and real world effects.\nY2K Bug\nIn 1999 the world faced a possibly very serious bug in the way that computer stored time. When computers stored the year they would only store the last two digits (e.g. 1999 is stored as just 99). This means that when the year 2000 happened lots of people were afraid that computer would think the year was the year 1900 instead of the year 2000.\nCheck out this very scary video here\nFortunately, a lot people put in a lot of work to stop the bug before it happened and averted catastrophe.\nDiscuss: Why did the Y2K bug happen? What oversights did the developers have?\nTherac-25\nTherac-25 was a machine used to administer radiation to cancer patients which malfunctioned because of a programmer error.\nWatch: You can watch a quick video about the bug here\nDiscuss: Why did the Y2K bug happen? What oversights did the developers have?\nThe Debugging Mindset\nDebugging is a fact of life! Not everything will work the first time you do it and even when it does there will often be times when even if you feel like you've covered everything another bug may occur!\nTask (5 Minutes)\nIn teams, the students should have quick discussion about the bugs that have occurred to them in the past. When they finish the class should regroup and gather together all the different types of bugs that have happened to them.\nTypes of Errors\nSyntax Errors\nThese errors are usually quite simple to fix and happen when you've typed some code wrong or missed a character. These will normally happen as soon as you run your code.\nExamples of Syntax Errors\nHow would we fix these syntax errors? Post your answers in Slack!\n\nSyntaxError: missing ) after condition\n\nif (3 > Math.PI {\n  console.log(\"wait what?\");\n}\n\n\nSyntaxError: missing variable name\n\nvar = 1;\n\n\nSyntaxError: missing } after function body\n\nvar charge = function() {\n  if (sunny) {\n    useSolarCells();\n  } else {\n    promptBikeRide();\n};\n\nReference Errors\nThese errors most commonly happen when you try to access variable that has not been defined anywhere.\nExamples of Reference Errors\nHow would we fix these reference errors? Post your answers in Slack!\n\nReferenceError: \"word\" is not defined\n\nvar ward = \"hello\";\nword.substring(1);\n\nType Errors\nType errors usually occur when you are trying to access a method or variable from an object that doesn't have that in it.\nExamples of Type Errors\n\nTypeError: document.getElByID is not a function\n\nvar submit = document.getElById(\"button\");\n\n\nTypeError: numbers.map is not a function\nHint: what type is the number variable\n\n\n\nvar numbers = { a: 13, b: 37, c: 42 };\n\nnumbers.map(function (num) {\n  return num * 2;\n});\n\n\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'substring' of undefined\n\nvar name;\nname.substring(1);\n\nThe Debugging Framework\nWhen debugging you should always ask yourself a few key questions\n\nWhat did I expect to happen?\n\nYou should very clearly be able to say exact what you expected to happen when you run your code. If you cannot do this, then you do not understand the problem well enough.\n\nIs it actually broken?\n\nSometime what you think is broken is actually working fine but not what you thought was going to happen. You should confirm with what the program is trying to do.\n\nWhat happened instead?\n\nYou should be able to quickly state what you were expecting to happen. Just saying \"It Didn't Work\" isn't enough! The more carefully you dissect the problem the more easily you'll be able to fix it.\n\nWhat have I tried so far?\n\nDebugging is a process of loops and iteration. Think about what you've done so far and work out other ways that the code could have broken.\nTools\nTask (5 Minutes)\nIn teams, the students should have quick discussion about the ways that they have solved bugs or errors they've had in the past.\nWhen they finish the discussion we should regroup and gather together all the ways that they have solved bugs in the past.\nThinking like a computer\nThe most important skill you can develop is thinking analytically and logically - exactly the same as a computer. In the exercises soon we will be using our logical skills to slowly step through a program to see what is going wrong.\nRemember that the computer will run your program line-by-line, from top to bottom, and that loops and functions may jump to a new location. If in doubt, try going through the program one line at a time - don't jump ahead, or guess what you want your program to do, make sure you're reading what it actually does do.\nWhen debugging, it can often be useful to write down what values variables have, either on paper, in comments, or by using console.log - this is particularly true in loops and functions, where variable values may change from iteration to iteration, or between calls!\nTest Often\nIt is important when working on your code to test each part of your code separately and carefully. Make sure everything is working before you move on to the next part otherwise problems become harder to debug.\nStackoverflow.com\nStackoverflow is a crucial tool for lots of new developers in finding answers to their programming problems. While a lot of the information is very good there are several points to keep in mind.\n\nInformation goes out of date very quickly\nYou have to make sure that what your looking at it new\n\n\nDon't copy and paste code\nIf you don't understand what your code does then there is no pointing using it since soon you won't be able to debug it\n\n\nThe Chosen Answer isn't always the right answer for you\nAlways read all the responses to questions to find the correct answer for you\n\n\n\nTalking It Through (a.k.a Rubber Ducking)\nWhen you're stuck on a problem one of the key techniques you can use is talking through your problem with somebody else. Being forced to slow down and think is important and you'll often realise your problem whilst trying to explain it so somebody else.\nNobody else around to ask? Still tell it to somebody! The act of talking helps you work through the problem. Traditionally, programmers use a rubber duck.\nUsing console.log() and the Console\nBy this point you will have seen console.log() quite a lot when we see what is happening in our programs - this tool can also be one of the key tools in debugging our programs!\nWhen we're working on websites you can view the Console tool in Chrome by\n\nRight Click\nInspect\nClick the Console tab\n\nHere you'll see all of the messages that have been printed by the website when it was loading and running.\nUsing the Chrome Debugger\nWe know that JavaScript executes code line by line. How great would it be if we had a tool that allowed us to stop code execution on any line and inspect the values of our variables. Fortunately such a tool exists and it's called a debugger. Here we will use the Chrome debugger for JavaScript, however similar tools exist of all other popular browsers.\nTo view the debugger go to the Sources tab of Chrome developer tools which we opened above.\nTo tell the debugger to stop we need to create a breakpoint, it's an instruction to the debugger to stop execution and await instruction from us.\nWe can place a debugger in one of two ways. We can either insert a line into our called saying\ndebugger;\n\nor we can click on the line number in the debugger tool itself.\nLet's say we have a simple piece of code below and we want to inspect the values of x and y before adding them.\nvar x = 10;\nvar y = 20;\n\nvar z = x * y;\n\nTo use debugger on above code we will save it in a file called temp.js and import it into an html file called temp.html.\nWe can either use the debugger statement to pause the code\nvar x = 10;\nvar y = 20;\ndebugger;\nvar z = x * y;\n\nor by opening the file in the debugger using the file navigation on the right hand side and clicking on line 4. Note you can pause on line with code not empty lines.\n\nOnce we have paused code execution, we can mouse over the the variables to see their values.\n\nOnce we have finished inspecting the values, we can use the controls in the top right corner to tell the debugger what to do.\n\nWe can click the button with the blue triangle to tell the debugger to continue executing code until it hits the next breakpoint. Or if we want to execute code line by line ourselves, we can press the button with the curved arrow that will the debugger to execute the current line and stop on the next line.\nTo remove a breakpoint you either remove the debugger statement or if you placed a breakpoint from the debugger itself, you can click that line number again to remove it.\nComparing console.log and debugger\nAs a developer you will likely use both tools to understand what your code is doing and help you fin and fix bugs. console.log can be a quick and easy way to check a value, but it can also be a bit inflexible since you can only inspect the value you log out in that one place.\nUsing the debug tool to inspect values can be a bit slower than console logging out values. However, it is also more flexible since you can inspect any value and move execution yourself line by line.\nTry using both methods in your exercises and homeworks to get more familiar with them.\nESLint in VSCode\nOften you will have code that is perfectly valid JavaScript, but it may possibly not do what you want it to do. For example, you might have misspelled a variable name and as a result the variable you wanted to using is now unused and the variable you using does not exist.\nTo catch such problems, we can use a static code analysis tool or commonly known as a linter. The most common one in use today is ESLint and it allows us to configure different rules to look out for and alert us when one of them is broken by our code.\nYou can use the ESLint extension for VSCode which you can download here.\nWe have created a sample ESLint configuration to help you get started. You can download it here.\n{\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"semi\": [\"warn\", \"always\"],\n    \"quotes\": [\"warn\", \"double\"],\n    \"eqeqeq\": [\"warn\", \"always\"],\n    \"no-unused-vars\": [\"warn\"],\n    \"no-redeclare\": [\"warn\"],\n    \"no-undef\": [\"warn\"]\n  }\n}\n\nsemi warns you if you did not use a semi colon at the end of the line\nquotes ensures consistency by warning you if you did not use double quote marks\neqeqeq ensures you use === and !== rather than == and != since the latter can lead to errors\nno-unused-vars will warn you if you have unused variables in your code\nno-redeclare will warn you if you redeclare an existing variable\nno-undef will warn you if you try to use an undeclared variable or function\nYou can see all rules and their explanations at https://eslint.org/docs/rules/. Many of them not make sense to you (they don't to me), but it can be a handy reference and over time your use and understanding of them will improve and increase.\nSummary\n\nBugs are a fact of life. No one produces bug free code.\nTest regularly to find bugs early.\nHaving multiple bugs in code can make them harder to deal with. See previous rule\nUse tools such a linters spot and prevent bugs early\nError messages might look scary, but they are your friend\nUse tools such as console.log and debugger to find root of bugs\n\nExercise 1\nAs a class we should step through solving all of the issues in this small piece of code. You should copy it into a code editor (e.g. VS Code) in a .js file so you can debug and run it easily. Be sure to use The Debugging Framework that we discussed earlier\n\n\nlet printValuesOf = (jsObject, keys) => {\n  for (let i = 0; i \nTry to categorise the bugs found under:\n\nLogical\nSyntactical\nOther (programmer/user error)\n\nExercise 2\nIn your groups we want you to go through this program and find all of the bugs that are happening in this code.\nYou can find the project here\n2.

Debugging Quiz\nLet's see what you remember from last week!\nAnswer in a thread on Slack\n\nWhat are the four questions we ask ourselves in the Debugging Framework?\nWhat are three of the tools we could use to debug our programs?\nWhat is a syntax error?\nWhat is a reference error?\nWhat is a type error?\n\n2. How the web works - quick recap\nIn this session we will look at how computer talk to each other using the web.\nAt the core of the web is the URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator. We use the term resource to mean anything that a server might return such as webpage, CSS, JavaScript, image, data etc. A good way to think of a URL is as an address. It allows us to refer to webpages, images, data etc that is stored on servers elsewhere.\nMethods\nThe main methods used to send requests on the web are GET and POST. However, later in the course when we look at building APIs using Node we will also look at other methods such as PUT, PATCH and DELETE.\nA GET method is a way of asking a server for a webpage, resource or a piece of data. For example, when we type a URL into a browser and submit it. The browser will send a GET request.\nA POST method is used to send data to a server.\nThe main difference between GET and POST is that a POST method has a body, that is it can contain some data that we are sending. Whereas a GET does not have a body since we use it to request data.\nHeaders\nEach request and response sent has meta data, information about the data, at the beginning called a header. The header contains information such as a\n\nstatus code indicating whether a request was successful\ncontent type which indicates what the request or response contains\n\nas well as lots of other things we won't cover here\nStatus codes\nEach response returned needs to contain a status code which tells the client whether the request was successful. If the request succeeded the response code will be 200. If the resource you tried to access was not found the response code used is 404.\nSome status codes you may have come across before are:\n\n200 ok. Request was successful\n301 moved permanently. Used to redirect request when moved permanently\n401 Unauthorised. User credentials were not supplied\n404 Not found\n500 Internal server error\n\nThe response codes can be grouped into categories\n\n1xx: Informational\n2xx: Success\n3xx: Redirection\n4xx: Client Error\n5xx: Server Error\n\nIf you want a fun look at HTTP codes, take a look at https://httpstatusdogs.com/ or https://http.cat/ if you are cat person. For a technical perspective take a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes.\nContent type\nWhen sending data across the web, we need to specify in the header what the request or response contains. To do that, the content-type header is used. That way the receiver knows what to do with the data received.\nCommon content types include\n\ntext/html - HTML web page\ntext/css - CSS\nimage/jpeg - JPEG image\napplication/javascript - JavaScript code\napplication/json - JSON data\n\nExercise\nIn Slack post answers to the following\n\n- What can HTTP headers contain?\n- What is the purpose of status codes?\n- What can an HTTP message contain?\n3. What are APIs and how to interact with them\nExplanation\n\nAPI stands for Application Programming Interface\nAPIs are created by providers and used by consumers\nIt is a specific part of a larger system that can be contacted by other systems, for example from the internet.\nWhen we connect to an API we say that we are connecting to an Endpoint\nSome well-known APIs are Facebook APIs, Twitter APIs, Maps APIs and many many more\nIn particular, an API doesn't care what language or technology is used in the consumer or the provider\n\nAn API is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk to it. An example of a server is the application on a computer hosting a website and an example of a client is the browser on the phone trying to access the website.\nWhy do we need APIs?\nImagine that I am a big social network and I want to give developers all over the world access to the data on the people on my website.\nWhat are some problems that I would have with sharing my data with everyone?\n\nSome of the information that I have is public (for example, peoples names) whilst other information I have is private (for example, email addresses). I want to make sure that I only ever give developers access to peoples names but never to their email addresses - otherwise they could send them spam email.\nI want to make sure that when developers ask for my data I can control who has access to it. I like that my users data is being used to make their lives better but I don't like it when companies try to sell them new stuff they don't need.\nSome developers might want to change some of the users details on my social network and this would get very messy quickly if people where allowed to change whatever they wanted\n\nAn API is a special type of program what acts as a gatekeeper to all of this information. Having an API means that I can control which information is shared about my users and who it is shared with. Perfect!\nTypes of APIs:\n\nPrivate: for employees only under a company network for internal use.\nSemi-private: for clients who paid for the API.\nPublic: for everyone on the web (but may or may not need an account to use).\n\nExamples\nHere is the API endpoint for Transport For London\nhttps://api.tfl.gov.uk\nThe data from this endpoint will be used by many apps that you use every day - Google Maps and Citymapper to name two.\nThis endpoint will get location of all of the Bikepoints in London.\nhttps://api.tfl.gov.uk/BikePoint\nThat's a lot of Bikes! It would be better if we could search for a location. Luckily this API let's us search for places.\nhttps://api.tfl.gov.uk/BikePoint/Search?query=Clerkenwell\nThis API also has lots of other endpoints that we can use to get other data. For example, lets find the Air Quality of London.\nhttps://api.tfl.gov.uk/AirQuality\nAs you can see the URL changes the data that we get from the API. This can be broken down like this\n\nExercise\nTask (5 mins):\nLet's use the TFL API to get data about the London Underground\n\nhttps://api.tfl.gov.uk\n\n1.  Which endpoint would you use to find out if there is a disruption on the 'central' line? 2. Does the 'central' line have a disruption right now? Name another line that has a disruption on it.\n\nHint: Use your browser to access the endpoints\nRecap\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following statements below about APIs is false?\n\nA) Public APIs can be accessed by anyone on the Internet.\nB) You must use Javascript to access an API.\nC) APIs can control access to data or features of an application.\nD) You can change data via an API.\nQuestion:\nGive an example of a company that uses an API to allow access to their data.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the `myapi/` part of a url called in this url?\nhttp://www.google.com/**myapi**/\n4. How to use fetch to do network requests\nExplanation\n\nFetch is a function to request from other places on the web\nFetch is defined in the browser which means it can be used without using an external library (window.fetch)\nFetch is available in nearly all browser but it's good to check which ones it won't work in\nWe can use this website to help us - caniuse.com)\n\n\nFetch API documentations by Mozilla link\n\nHow does fetch work?\nFetch uses a JavaScript pattern called \"Promises\" which has a very specific structure.\nYou can think of a Promise as you would think of a promise you make to another person - you make a promise that something will happen in the future. For example - I promise to call you later, I promise to go to the shops and buy milk later.\nUsing Promises allows us to schedule functions to be called after some asynchronous code finishes running. We can specify different functions depending on whether the asynchronous code was successful or ran into an error.\nPromises can make it easier to split our code into small functions and make code easier to read. They also make it easier to handle errors.\nIn this example we\n\nGet the Promise that we will get the milk from the shops (this could take a long time so it's good that it's a Promise!)\nWhen the milk has arrived from the shop then I should drink it and return the bottle so I can do something else with it\nWhen I've drank the milk then I should recycle the bottle\nIf anything goes wrong with those steps I should catch the error and warn everyone what happened\n\nExample\ngetMilkFromShops\n  .then((milk) => {\n    console.log(`I've got the milk`);\n    milk.drink();\n    return milk.bottle;\n  })\n  .then((bottle) => {\n    console.log(`I'm going to recycle the bottle`);\n    bottle.recycle();\n  })\n  .catch((error) => console.warn(\"Oh no, I dropped the milk\"));\n\nExample 1\nLive Coding Exercise\nLet's step through how the Fetch function is used and what it is comprised of\n//Retrieve the JSON\nfetch(\"https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts\")\n  // Get the response and extract the JSON\n  .then(function (response) {\n    return response.json();\n  })\n  // Do something with the JSON\n  .then((headlines) => {\n    console.log(headlines);\n  })\n  // If something goes wrong\n  .catch((error) => console.log(error));\n\nExample 2\nLive Coding Exercise\nWouldn't it be cool to make a new friend with just the click of a button?\nWrite a function that makes an API call using fetch to https://www.randomuser.me/api\n\nThe function should make an API call to the given endpoint: https://www.randomuser.me/api\nLog the received data to the console\nIncorporate error handling\nShow how you can build a profile page for the user using the DOM\nAdd a name\nAdd a profile picture\nAdd some styling using CSS\n\n\n\nError handling\nWe saw earlier that each HTTP response contains an status code which indicates if our request was successful or not. If the our request failed we usually want to handle it appropriately.\nWe can handle these errors gracefully in your code by checking the status and statusText value of the response:\nfetch(\"https://httpstat.us/500\")\n  .then((response) => {\n    if (response.status >= 200 && response.status  {\n    // do whatever you want with the JSON response\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    // Handle the error\n    console.log(error);\n  });\n\nExercises\nExercise 1\nIn groups the students should create a page of details about the United Kingdom.\nThe API endpoint can be found here\nThe website should include\n\nThe name of the country\nThe country's capital city\nAn unordered list of the country's name in other all of the other returned languages\n\nSteps\nExample html and javascript files can be found in the section below\n\nCreate a HTML, CSS and JavaScript file to hold different types of code\nIn your HTML file, write a simple basis for your website (e.g. this)\nMake sure all of your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files are linked together!\n\n\nWrite a function using fetch that retrieves the JSON from the Country API\nTo make sure it's working print the JSON to the console using console.log()\n\n\nCreate a h1 tag on the website using DOM manipulation and add the country's name inside it\nGo back to Week 5 if you need a reminder\n\n\nCreate a h2 tag on the website using DOM manipulation and add the capital city's name inside it\nCreate a ul tag on the website using DOM manipulation\nFor each of the translated names in the JSON, add a li tag\n\n\nUncomment the lines inside onLoad() to load other countries details!\n\nExtra\n\nLoad the country's flag into an img tag\nAdd CSS to make your website look really nice\nAdd other information from the JSON to your Country Details\n\nFramework Files\nindex.html\n\n\n  \n    \n\n    Country Information\n    \n    \n\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nscripts.js\n// This function should retrieve the JSON from the `countryURL` and then call onCountryDataReceived() with the JSON\nfunction getData(countryURL) {}\n\nfunction onCountryDataReceived(country) {\n  addCountryName(country);\n  addCountryCapital(country);\n  addNameInOtherLanguages(country);\n}\n\n// This function should take the JSON for the country and put a H1 tag on the screen containing its name\nfunction addCountryName(countryData) {}\n\n// This function should take the JSON for the country and put a H2 tag on the screen containing its capital city\nfunction addCountryCapital(countryData) {}\n\n// This function should take the JSON for the country and put UL and LI tags on the screen with the countries name translated into other languages\nfunction addNameInOtherLanguages(countryData) {}\n\nfunction getContentDiv() {\n  return document.querySelector(\"#content\");\n}\n\nfunction onLoad() {\n  getData(\n    \"https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Great%20Britain?fullText=true\"\n  );\n\n  /** Remove this line when you have completed the task\n\n    getData(\"https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/France?fullText=true\");\n\n    getData(\"https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Germany?fullText=true\");\n\n    getData(\"https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Spain?fullText=true\");\n\n    getData(\"https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Portugal?fullText=true\");\n\n    getData(\"https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Hungary?fullText=true\");\n\n    getData(\"https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Russia?fullText=true\");\n\n    */ // Remove this line when you have completed the task\n}\n\nwindow.onload = onLoad;\n\nFinished Example\nYou can find the finished example of this website here.\nRecap\nQuestion (5 mins):\nComplete the following sentence:\n\nFetch is a web API that allows you to **\\_** from **\\_**.\nTask (5 mins):\nComplete the rest of this code to connect to the following API: `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`\n\n    fetch(_____)\n    .then(_____)\n    .then(body => console.log(body))\n    .catch(error => console.log(error));\n\n1.

Variable Scope\nThe Problem\nVariables are amazing! Variables let us store data and reuse it many times rather than writing the same data over and over again, also if the variables are well named then it makes it much easier to think about what our code is doing.\nAs we know, after we declare or define a new variable we can refer to it later in our code using the variable name.\nlet name = \"mo\";\nlet age = 42;\nlet favouriteFoods = [\"pizza\", \"apples\", \"tofu\"];\n\n// lots of code here\n\n// later\nconsole.log(\"my name is \" + name);\n\nNow, imagine what would happen when our code gets really long. Every time we want to define a new variable we have to check that it hasn't already been used for something else. If that variable is already being used and we redefine it, bad things can happen. We could overwrite something important.\nImagine a banking app being built by two developers. Developer 1 uses the variable name money to store the total amount of cash a single customer has in the bank, Developer 2 uses the variable name money to store the total amount of cash that ALL customers have in the bank added together, the total money in the bank's vaults. This could be really good news for a customer who accidentally receives the entire bank's money in their account, but really BAD news for us as the owners of a bank.\nThe Solution\nOne solution might be that every time we want to create a new variable, we call around all of the other developers on the project and ask them if it's safe to use the variable name money. We can quickly see a problem with this, some codebases are millions of lines long! No single person knows what is contained in every file. It would be impossible to know what variables are safe to use and which are not.\nInstead, we need to find a way to make variables safer. We need a way to use the best variable name to describe our data, without worrying that we will be causing problems in a different part of the codebase.\nWe call this scope.\nWhat is Scope?\nThink about the way that laws are set in different countries. Most laws are set by the government of that country and are local to that country. However, some laws are international, laws like 'no slavery' apply across all countries, these are global laws.\nIn some countries, different regions inside the country can set their own laws too. In America you must be 21 to drink (national law), but in the state of Massachusetts all bars must be closed by 2AM (state law). These are two levels of local laws.\n\nIn Massachusetts, a citizen must follow all 3: International Law, National Law and State Law.\nBut a pirate &#x1F3F4;‍☠️ in the middle of the ocean only needs to follow International Law (and perhaps the law of the Ship).\nIn the same way we think about which laws apply to which parts of a country we must also think about which variables apply to which parts of your code. Variables, like laws, only apply to a certain area.\nWhen we try to access a variable that does not exist or has gone out of scope, JavaScript will throw a ReferenceError telling us that a variable is not defined.\nlet globalLaw = \"no slavery\";\n// only 1 law applies here\n\nfunction usa() {\n  let nationalLaw = \"drinking age is 21\";\n  // 2 laws apply here\n\n  function massachusetts() {\n    let stateLaw = \"bars closed at 2am\";\n    // all 3 laws apply here\n  }\n}\n\nconsole.log(stateLaw); // Error: 'stateLaw' is not defined\n\nIn the example above, the State Law only applies to Massachusetts. When we try to console.log the stateLaw variable at the end, it is not defined. This part of your code does not even know this variable exists!\nGlobal scope\nVariables declared outside of any function or code block are available throughout an application. They are referred to as global variables and exist in global scope.\nWe can see in the previous example that globalLaw is a global variable.\nBecause global variables are visible by throughout the application, data stored in them can be read and updated by any part of your code. At first this might seem convenient, but in practice this is likely to cause problems in longer term as your code base grows.\n\nIt may not be obvious where in your code global variables are used, which can make refactoring hard\nOther part of your code may accidentally overwrite values in global variables and lead to bugs.\n\nBecause of above it is good engineering practice to only use global variables when absolutely necessary.\nNote that you can also declare a global variable by assigning to a variable without declaring it with a var, let or const keyword.\nfunction accidentallyGlobal() {\n  oops = \"I am global\";\n}\n\naccidentallyGlobal();\n\nconsole.log(oops);\n\nBe sure to keep an eye out for above problem and avoid it.\nLocal Variables\nLet's rewind and look at this in detail. We know that variables are declared using the var, let or const keyword.\nlet greeting = \"Hi \";\n\nIf we define a variable inside a function, it becomes local to that function. If we want to use a fancy word, we can also say it becomes scoped to that function.\nfunction greetUser(name) {\n  let greeting = \"Hi \"; // This variable only exists here\n  console.log(greeting + name);\n}\n\ngreetUser(\"Naima\");\nconsole.log(greeting); // It doesn't exist here\n\nThe console.log(greeting) on the last line throws an error, it tells us that \"greeting is not not defined\". Why is this? Because the variable greeting was defined in the greetUser function, it does not exist outside the function.\nThis lets us do new things with variables. You cannot usually create two variables with the same name. For example:\nfunction greetUser(name) {\n  let greeting = \"Hi\";\n  let greeting = \"Shalom\";\n  // Error: 'greeting' has already been declared\n}\n\nBut in the same way countries have own laws, functions have own scopes! And so it becomes possible to use the same variable name for different situations.\nfunction greetOnce(name) {\n  let greeting = \"Hi \";\n  console.log(greeting + name);\n}\n\nfunction greetAgain(name) {\n  let greeting = \"Shalom \";\n  console.log(greeting + name);\n}\n\nWe have used the variable name greeting twice but it's very important to remember that these are not the same variable! The two variables called 'greeting' do not even know each other exist.\nNesting\nIt is important to note that scope is nested. That means when you have one function inside another function, you can access variables defined in outer function from the inner function. However you cannot access variables defined in inner function from outer function.\nfunction grandfather() {\n  let name = \"Hammad\";\n  // likes is not accessible here\n  function parent() {\n    // name is accessible here\n    // likes is not accessible here\n    function child() {\n      // Innermost level of the scope chain\n      // name is also accessible here\n      let likes = \"Coding\";\n    }\n\n    child();\n  }\n\n  parent();\n}\n\ngrandfather();\n\nBlock scope\nCode block\nA block is piece of code inside by curly brackets, for example following if statements and for or while loops.\nif (age > 18) {\n  // code block\n}\n\nvar vs let and const\nIn addition to previous scope rules, JavaScript uses different scope methods for variables depending how they are defined.\n\nVariables declared using var keyword use function scope. That means variables defined using var exist within function they are defined in.\nVariables declared using let or const keyword use block scope. Variables defined using let or const keywords exist within the block they are defined in.\n\nfunction getBook() {\n  if (true) {\n    var bookOne = \"JavaScript: The Good Parts\";\n    let bookTwo = \"Eloquent JavaScript\";\n    const bookThree = \"The JS Way\";\n  }\n\n  console.log(bookOne); // JavaScript: The Good Parts\n  console.log(bookTwo); // ReferenceError: bookTwo is not defined\n  console.log(bookThree); // ReferenceError: bookThree is not defined\n}\n\nAny time you define a variable inside a block, that variable cannot escape that block. We say the variable is scoped to that block.\nScope allows us to control where our variables can be accessed from. We want to ensure that variables are available where they are needed and ideally as little as possible elsewhere to prevent naming collisions or accidental updates. As a result using let or const is preferrable to using var since they has stricter scope definition.\nExercise\nIn small groups answer the following the questions. Try to solve each exercise before running code to verify answer. Try to explain your answer using what you learned above about scope. Think about the order JavaScript will execute each piece of code and what the values will be at each stage.\n// 1.\nfunction one() {\n  var a = 10;\n}\none();\nconsole.log(a); // what is the value of a\n\n// 2.\nfunction two() {\n  let b = 10;\n  let b = 20;\n}\ntwo();\nconsole.log(b); // what is the value of b and why\n\n// 3.\nlet c;\nfunction three() {\n  c = 25;\n}\nthree();\nconsole.log(c); // what is the value of c and why\n\n// 4.\nfunction four() {\n  d = 25;\n}\nfour();\nconsole.log(d); // what is the value of d and why\n\n// 5.\nlet e;\nfunction five() {\n  const greeting = \"Hello\";\n\n  function greet() {\n    let name = \"Eddie\";\n    e = `${greeting} ${name}`;\n  }\n  greet();\n}\nfive();\nconsole.log(e); // what is the value of e and why\n\n// 6.\nfunction six() {\n  if (true) {\n    let f = 50;\n  }\n  console.log(f); // what is the value of f and why\n}\n\nsix();\n\n2. Classes\nVariables can be used to hold information about the state your code is in, e.g. how many times someone has clicked on a button:\nlet timesClicked = 0;\n\nlet whenButtonClicked = () => {\n  timesClicked++;\n  console.log(`Button has been clicked ${timesClicked} times`);\n};\n\ndocument\n  .querySelector(\"#myButton\")\n  .addEventListener(\"click\", whenButtonClicked);\n\nHowever, you may end up being in a situation where you'll have to keep track of the click state of multiple buttons, or even a dynamic number of buttons:\nlet timesClicked1 = 0;\nlet timesClicked2 = 0;\n\nlet whenButtonClicked1 = () => {\n  timesClicked1++;\n  console.log(`Button has been clicked ${timesClicked1} times`);\n};\n\nlet whenButtonClicked2 = () => {\n  timesClicked2++;\n  console.log(`Button has been clicked ${timesClicked2} times`);\n};\n\ndocument\n  .querySelector(\"#myButton1\")\n  .addEventListener(\"click\", whenButtonClicked1);\ndocument\n  .querySelector(\"#myButton2\")\n  .addEventListener(\"click\", whenButtonClicked2);\n\nWe can reduce this code duplication by using a JavaScript class (not the same as a class in CSS). Classes are templates which are used to create objects containing methods and properties of the class. For example here the class Counter ties together the state, timesClicked, and the functions that reference it like whenButtonClicked:\nclass Counter {\n  constructor() {\n    this.timesClicked = 0;\n  }\n\n  whenClicked() {\n    this.timesClicked++;\n    console.log(`Button has been clicked ${this.timesClicked} times`);\n  }\n}\n\nlet counter1 = new Counter();\nlet counter2 = new Counter();\n\ndocument\n  .querySelector(\"#myButton1\")\n  .addEventListener(\"click\", () => counter1.whenClicked());\ndocument\n  .querySelector(\"#myButton2\")\n  .addEventListener(\"click\", () => counter2.whenClicked());\n\nWe can create instances of a class using the new operator, followed by the class name. When a class instance is created, its constructor function is called automatically. We can pass the constructor arguments to use during initialisation.\nFor example, here is a CounterFromN class that starts counting from a number that's passed in:\nclass CounterFromN {\n  constructor(n) {\n    this.timesClicked = n;\n  }\n\n  whenClicked() {\n    this.timesClicked++;\n    console.log(`Button has been clicked ${this.timesClicked} times`);\n  }\n}\n\nlet counterFromTen = new CounterFromN(10);\n\ncounterFromTen.whenClicked();\n// Button has been clicked 11 times\n\nAs shown above, a class' functions can be called by referring to the name of the object's function followed by brackets. If the function expects any arguments then these can be passed into it inside the brackets as per normal. Functions defined within classes are also be known as methods.\nVariables specific to a particular instance of a class are defined and referenced using the this keyword (e.g. this.timesClicked) within that instance. this refers to the object which is created by the class when it instantiated.\nExercises\nTry these exercises in your breakout groups.\nExercise 1\nImplement the add and getTotal methods of the RunningTotal class below.\nclass RunningTotal {\n  constructor() {\n    this.currentTotal = 0;\n  }\n\n  add(n) {\n    // Implement this method\n  }\n  getTotal() {\n    // Implement this method\n  }\n}\n\nconst runningTotal = new RunningTotal();\n\nrunningTotal.add(3);\nrunningTotal.add(7);\nrunningTotal.add(7);\nrunningTotal.getTotal();\n// 17\n\nExercise 2\nImplement the constructor method of the StopWatch class below.\nclass StopWatch {\n  constructor() {\n    this.secondsElapsed = 0;\n\n    //Finish implementing the rest of the constructor so that secondsElapsed is updated\n  }\n\n  getTime() {\n    return `Seconds elapsed: ${this.secondsElapsed}`;\n  }\n}\n\nconst stopWatch = new StopWatch();\n\n// Wait a few seconds...\n\nstopWatch.getTime();\n// 'Seconds elapsed: 3'\n\n// Wait a few more seconds...\n\nstopWatch.getTime();\n// 'Seconds elapsed: 7'\n\nExercise 3\nImplement the constructor, store and the lookup methods of the AddressBook class below.\nclass AddressBook {\n  // Implement the constructor method\n  // Implement the store method\n  // Implement the lookup method\n}\n\nconst myAddresBook = new AddressBook();\n\nmyAddressBook.store(\"bart\", \"bart@simpsons.com\");\nmyAddressBook.store(\"maggie\", \"maggie@simpsons.com\");\n\nmyAddressBook.lookup(\"bart\");\n// 'bart@simpsons.com'\n\nmyAddressBook.lookup(\"homer\");\n// 'address not found'\n\nNotice that when you come to using a class instance, you are only interacting with it through its methods, e.g. store and lookup for AddressBook. Similar to functions, classes provide a way of creating abstractions over lower-level implementations, which can help us better organise and maintain our code.\n4. this keyword\nOne aspect of JavaScript that often leads to confusion is the keyword this. Its value depends on where it is used and how that function is called.\nthis in a constructor\nWe saw previously that a constructor in a class is a special method which is used to instantiate on a new object. When used inside a constructor, this refers to the new object being created.\nclass Person {\n  constructor() {\n    console.log(this);\n    this.name = \"Mike\";\n  }\n}\n\nconst person = new Person();\n\nthis in a method\nA method is a function that belongs to an object. That object can be either be created as an object literal or using a class.\nclass Person {\n  constructor() {\n    this.name = \"Mike\";\n  }\n\n  sayHi() {\n    console.log(`Hi, ${this.name}`);\n  }\n}\n\nconst person = new Person();\nperson.sayHi();\n\nIn both above example sayHi is a method which belong to person.\nWhen a method is called, the value of this inside of that method will be the object that the method belongs to. In the example above that will be person.\nthis in a function\nThe value of this in a standalone function if it's executed in the browser will be the window object. If it is executed in Node it will be the global object.\nfunction sayHey() {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nsayHey();\n\nmethods called as functions\nWe can take a method and assign it to a variable. Essentially that turns it from being a method into a standalone function.\nclass Person {\n  constructor() {\n    this.name = \"Mike\";\n  }\n\n  sayHi() {\n    console.log(`Hi, ${this.name}`);\n  }\n}\n\nconst person = new Person();\nconst sayHi = person.sayHi;\n\nsayHi(); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined\n\nIn above example, we are executing sayHi as a function, not method. As a result we no longer have access to the object the method belongs to. That results in the value of this being lost and instead of being person it is now undefined.\nThat can be a problem. Fortunately we can fix it\narrow functions to the rescue\nLatest versions of JavaScript allow us to declare methods in classes using arrow functions. When an arrow function is used, the value of this inside it is bound to the object it belongs to. That allows us to call methods as functions without losing the value of this inside it.\nclass Person {\n  constructor() {\n    this.name = \"Mike\";\n  }\n\n  sayHi = () => {\n    console.log(`Hi, ${this.name}`);\n  };\n}\n\nconst person = new Person();\nconst sayHi = person.sayHi;\n\nsayHi(); // Hi, Mike\n\nThis behaviour will become important in the near future, when we will need to start passing methods to be called other parts of our code.\nExercises\nIn break out groups solve the following exercises. Only run code to verify answers. Try to understand what each line of code is doing and the effect it has.\n// Exercise 1\nclass Car {\n  goFaster() {\n    this.speed = 100; // what is the value of this code below is run\n  }\n}\n\nconst ferrari = new Car();\nferrari.goFaster();\n\n// Exercise 2\nclass Car {\n  goFaster() {\n    this.speed = 100; // what is the value of this code below is run\n  }\n}\n\nconst honda = new Car();\nconst quicker = honda.goFaster;\n\nquicker();\n\n// Exercise 3\n\n// How can we fix the bug above? Why do have a problem and how does your solution fix it?\n\n4.

It is used for making complex, interactive user interfaces. It has become very popular in the last 5 years.\nWhy has it become so popular?\n\nIt is fast and efficient\nIt is easy to understand & less verbose than the \"vanilla\" JS API\nIt helps separate functionality into small, understandable pieces\n\nWhat is a component?\nReact heavily relies on a concept called \"components\". Components are like small Lego blocks for designing and developing user interfaces (UI). They can be stuck together in different ways to create new UI.\nLet's have a look at an example: the GitHub header. What are the logical \"pieces\" of UI? What could be a component?\n\nHere we've highlighted some elements that could be components:\n\nComponent tips\nThere are no hard & fast rules for making components. UIs can be split up into components in many different ways, requiring judgement based on your context.\n\nComponents should follow the Single Responsibility Principle\nEach component should only have 1 \"responsibility\"\nShould only do 1 thing\n\n\nComponents should have good, explicit names\nThis helps you to remember what the component's job is\n\n\n\n\nExercise A:\nLook at the example online shopping user interface in the Thinking in React article (the image at the top). Draw boxes around the components and give them names. Compare with the example components shown in the second image.\n\nRendering with React\nRemember how annoying it was to manage the DOM yourself in our previous lesson? The \"vanilla\" JavaScript APIs for updating the DOM are quite long and difficult to remember. React makes this easier by manipulating each DOM element itself, instead of you doing it manually. You give React a \"description\" of the DOM that you want and it will update the DOM for you. React abstracts away the management of the DOM.\nLet's take a look at an example. We are going to walk through how to render a  with the text \"Hello World\" within it.\nFirst, lets recap how we could do this using \"vanilla\" JS (interactive version):\nvar divNode = document.createElement(\"div\");\ndivNode.innerText = \"Hello World\";\n\nvar rootElement = document.querySelector(\"#root\");\nrootElement.appendChild(divNode);\n\nNow let's convert to using React (interactive version):\nconst element = React.createElement(\"div\", {\n  children: \"Hello World\",\n});\n\nconst rootElement = document.querySelector(\"#root\");\nReactDOM.render(element, rootElement);\n\nJSX\nAs you can see, React is already helping us a bit by cleaning up some of the verbose vanilla JS APIs. However in a typical React application you would still use a lot of the React.createElement function. To improve the developer experience the React team developed JSX.\nJSX is a simple syntax sugar that looks like HTML, but is actually converted to the React.createElement function when you run it.\nUsing JSX (interactive version):\nconst element = Hello World;\n\nconst rootElement = document.querySelector(\"#root\");\nReactDOM.render(element, rootElement);\n\nAs you can see, this is much easier to read than both the straight React.createElement API and the vanilla JS API. Most people using React use JSX to write their components.\n\nExercise B:\nChange the JSX example from above to instead render a h1 tag with the text \"Hello Code Your Future\".\n\nLet's create a React app\n\nExercise C:\nIf you haven't already, follow [the instructions to create a React app] called pokedex(https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/students/guides/creating-a-react-app).\n\nWhat got created?\n\n\n\n(click image for live diagram)\nReact Components\nWe looked at the beginning of the lesson at the concept of components. Now let's look at how components are made in React.\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\nfunction HelloWorld() {\n  return Hello World;\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(, document.querySelector(\"#root\"));\n\nThere are 3 important parts in this code:\n\nFirst we import React. This is important because JSX is converted to React.createElement calls. If the React variable is undefined then this will fail.\nWe create a React component called HelloWorld.\nWe render the HelloWorld component into a div with the id of root.\n\n\nExercise D:\nIn the pokedex React app that you just created, open the src/App.js file\n\nDelete everything in the file except the line containing export default App. You should see an error in your terminal and in your web browser - don't panic! We're going to remake the App component ourselves\nImport React variable from the React package\nCreate a function named App, which will be our component\nWithin the App function, return a  element with the text \"Welcome to the Pokedex\". What do you see in your web browser?\nCreate a  element that wraps around the  you just created\nBelow the  element (but within the ), create an  element. Then make its src attribute equal to https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/016.png. What do you expect to see in your web browser?\nNow create a  element to wrap both the  element and the  element\n\n\nComponent Composition\nA component can be combined with another component so that both are rendered. This is called composition (interactive example):\nfunction Greeting() {\n  return Hello;\n}\n\nfunction Mentor() {\n  return Ali;\n}\n\nfunction HelloWorld() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nIn the HelloWorld component we are using a reference to the Greeting and Mentor components. React reads these references when rendering HelloWorld and so it renders the Greeting and Mentor child components.\nWe are also using some shorter syntax within the HelloWorld component.  is just a shorter way of writing , which is useful if we don't need to put anything inside the Greeting component.\nNotice how the components that we write (HelloWorld, Greeting, Mentor) are written using a camel case convention and always start with an uppercase letter? And \"regular DOM\" components (div, span) are always lowercase? This the convention to let you know whether you are using a \"regular DOM component\" or a component that you have written.\n\nExercise E:\nIn your pokedex React app, open the src/App.js file\n\nCreate a new function named Logo\nCopy the  element and its contents and paste it into the Logo component\nReplace the  element in the App component with the new Logo component\nCreate a new component function named BestPokemon and return a  element with some text saying which is your favourite Pokemon (e.g. \"My favourite Pokemon is Squirtle\")\nRender your new BestPokemon component below the Logo component within the App component\n\n\nArrow Functions for shorter syntax\nBecause a React component is just a function, we can also use the arrow function syntax:\nconst HelloWorld = () => {\n  return Hello World;\n};\n\nThis can be even shorter again if we use parentheses and implicit return:\nconst HelloWorld = () => (\n  Hello World\n);\n\nAlthough this is shorter, it is less flexible as we cannot insert code that is not JSX. Like for example, a console.log:\n// THIS DOES NOT WORK!\nconst HelloWorld = () => (\n  console.log('Hello!')\n  Hello world\n);\n\nIf we want to do this, we can still use arrow functions but we can't use the implicit return.\n\nExercise F:\nUsing the pokedex React app that you created earlier and open the src/App.js file\nConvert the Logo and BestPokemon functions into arrow functions\n\nEmbedding JavaScript into JSX\nSo far all of the components we have looked at haven't been able to change - they are hard-coded. But this doesn't make very interesting websites, we want to be able to use variables with different data. We can insert variables (and some other things) into our React components.\nAnything in the JSX that is inside curly braces {} is interpreted as a regular JavaScript expression. That means you can use every object or function from JavaScript that we have learned so far. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nconst Greeting = () => {\n  const greetingWord = \"Hello\";\n\n  return (\n    {greetingWord}\n  )\n};\n\nNow instead of hard-coding the greeting in the Greeting component, we are using a variable. Remember that everything between the curly braces is just regular JavaScript. So we can use more than just variables (interactive example):\nconst Mentor = () => {\n  const mentors = [\"Ali\", \"Sub\", \"Loic\", \"Anthony\", \"Lucy\", \"Mozart\"];\n\n  return (\n    {mentors.join(\", \")}\n  )\n};\n\nNow we have modified the Mentor component to use the Array.join method so that it lists several mentor's names. This also works with other JS types:\nconst Addition = () => {\n  return (\n    {1 + 2 + 3}\n  )\n};\n\nconst Weather = () => {\n  const weatherData = {\n    temperature: 5,\n    location: \"London\",\n  };\n\n  return (\n    \n      The temperature in {weatherData.location} is {weatherData.temperature}\n    \n  );\n};\n\nfunction formatName(user) {\n  return user.firstName + \" \" + user.lastName;\n}\n\nconst Name = () => {\n  const user = {\n    firstName: \"Bob\",\n    lastName: \"Marley\",\n  };\n  return {formatName(user)};\n};\n\nA common pattern in React is to use Array.map to loop through a list of items and render a component for each one (interactive example):\nconst mentors = [\"Ali\", \"Sub\", \"Loic\", \"Anthony\", \"Lucy\", \"Mozart\"];\n\nconst List = () => (\n  \n    {mentors.map((name) => {\n      return (\n        {name}\n      )\n    })}\n  \n);\n\nHere we are using Array.map to turn an array of strings into an array of components.\n\nExercise G:\nUsing the pokedex React app that you created earlier and open the src/App.js file\n\nInside the Logo component create a new variable called appName and assign it to \"Pokedex\"\nNow replace the hard-coded app name with {appName}. What do you see in your web browser? What would you do if you wanted to change the app name?\nCreate a new component named CaughtPokemon. Within this component return a  tag with the text \"Caught 0 Pokemon on\" (we're going to fill in today's date in the next step)\nCreate a variable named date within the CaughtPokemon component, and assign it today's date (hint: new Date().toLocaleDateString()). Finally, render the date variable after the text \"Caught 0 Pokemon on\"\nRender the CaughtPokemon component within the App component (below BestPokemon)\nWithin the BestPokemon component, create a variable named abilities and assign it to an array with some Pokemon abilities (e.g. ['Anticipation', 'Adaptability', 'Run-Away'])\nChange the BestPokemon component to return a  element with the existing  element inside it. Then add a  element underneath the  element\nNow use the .map() method on the abilities variable to loop over each name and return a  element for each (hint: look at the mentors list example above) within the  element\n\n\nKeys\nYou may have noticed that we are now seeing a red error message in the Dev Tools: Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique \"key\" prop.. This error happens when you use Array.map to return a list of elements (interactive example):\nconst mentors = [\"Ali\", \"Sub\", \"Loic\", \"Anthony\", \"Lucy\", \"Mozart\"];\n\nconst List = () => (\n  \n    {mentors.map((name, index) => {\n      return (\n        {name};\n      )\n    })}\n  \n);\n\nHere we have added a key prop to the li element. A documentation page explaining in more depth is in the further reading section but basically the key prop has a special meaning in React because it is used internally to keep track of which element in the list is which.\nImporting/Exporting Components\nTo help organise your code, components can be imported and exported just like any other JavaScript code (interactive example):\nimport Greeting from \"./Greeting\";\nimport Mentor from \"./Mentor\";\n\nconst HelloMentor = () => (\n  \n    \n    \n  \n);\n\nWe also need to export our components if we want to use them in other files:\nconst Greeting = () => (\n  Hello\n);\n\nexport default Greeting;\n\nThe convention is to name component files exactly the same as the component (including the capital letter).\n\nExercise H:\nUsing the pokedex React app that you created earlier\n\nCreate a new file within the src directory named Logo.js\nCopy and paste the Logo component from App.js into Logo.js\nRemember to add import React from 'react' at the top of Logo.js\nExport the Logo component from Logo.js (hint: look at the Greeting example above)\nDelete the old Logo component from App.js\nImport the Logo component into App.js (hint: look at the HelloMentor example above)\nRepeat this process with the BestPokemon and CaughtPokemon components. What do you think the files should be called?\n\n\nMaking an argument for Props\nWhat's the problem with our HelloMentor component above?\nThe component HelloMentor is very static. What if we want to say hello to a different mentor? Currently, we would have to change the code too! This is easy in our tiny application but for \"real\" applications this might be more difficult.\nInstead wouldn't it be good if we could change which mentor we are saying hello to every time we render the component? So we could reuse the HelloMentor component for different mentor names. This is what props are for.\nWhat are Props?\nProps are what we use in React to pass \"arguments\" to components. They are very similar to arguments in functions - you can \"pass\" props to components, and you can use those props within a component.\nFirst let's look at passing props to your components (interactive example):\n\n\nAs you can see props are key-value pairs, in this example the key is name and the value is the string 'Mozafar'. We can pass as many props as we like to a component.\nWe don't have to use strings, we can use any valid JavaScript data like numbers, arrays and objects. Remember that in JSX you can use curly braces {} to inject data that is not a string:\n\n\nNow let's take a look at using props that we have passed to a component (interactive example):\nconst Mentor = (props) => {\n  console.log(props);\n  return (\n    {props.name};\n  )\n};\n\nReact gives you access to props in the first argument to the component function. We can then inject props into our component using curly braces.\nThe props variable is just a normal object with key-value pairs that match what was passed to the component. Because it is just a variable, it can be used like any other variable. That includes injecting props into attributes:\n{props.name}\n\nOr calculating new values:\n{props.age + 1}\n\n\nExercise I\nUsing the pokedex React app that you created earlier\n\nOpen the App.js file\nPass a prop appName=\"Pokedex\" to the Logo component\nNow open the Logo.js file\nDelete the appName variable. What do you see in your web browser? Why?\nChange the Logo function to access the first argument and call it props. Use console.log to inspect the props variable\nChange the usage of appName in the  to be props.appName instead. Does this fix the problem? Why?\nNow open the BestPokemon.js file\nCopy the abilities variable and then delete it from BestPokemon.js\nPaste the abilities variable into App.js\nPass the abilities variable as a prop to BestPokemon from App.js\nIn the BestPokemon.js file replace the existing usage of abilities with the abilities prop. You should still see the Pokemon ability names in your web browser\n(STRETCH GOAL) Repeat the process with the date variable in the CaughtPokemon.js file\n\n\nFurther reading\nFed up of having to provide a prop for every component? Do you want to make your component use a value most of the time, but it can be overridden with a prop? This is a good time to use defaultProps. This page on the React documentation describes in more detail.\n\nExercise J\nComplete the FreeCodeCamp exercises on defaultProps:\n\nUse Default Props\nOverride Default Props\n\n\nCredits\nInspiration & examples for this module were taken from Kent C.

This week we will look at making our apps dynamic.\nRecap: First-class functions in JavaScript\nBefore we look more at React we need to recap a concept in JavaScript. You may remember that functions in JavaScript are \"first class\" - that means we can pass a reference to a function (as a variable) and then call it elsewhere. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nfunction hello() {\n  return \"Hello!\";\n}\n\nconsole.log(hello);   // Logs: \"ƒ hello() {}\"\nconsole.log(hello()); // Logs: \"Hello!\"\n\nIn the example above hello is a reference to a function. In the first console.log we log out the whole function. The function is not called until we use parentheses (), so we only log the string \"Hello!\" in the second console.log.\nThis is a really important and useful in React, as we can make a function and pass it to React so that it can call it when a user interacts with our app.\nEvent handlers in components\nIn previous lessons we learned how to attach event listeners with addEventListener:\n// Create an event handler\nfunction logWhenClicked() {\n  console.log('buttonElement was clicked!')\n}\n\n// Listen for events and call the event handler when triggered\nbuttonElement.addEventListener('click', logWhenClicked)\n\nWe still need to listen events in React, but event handlers are set up in a slightly different way (interactive example):\nfunction ClickLogger() {\n  function logWhenClicked() {\n    console.log(\"Button was clicked!\")\n  }\n\n  return Click me!\n}\n\nYou might find it a little strange that we have a function inside a function. But this is a normal thing to do in JavaScript! logWhenClicked is within the scope of our ClickLogger component.\nEvery element in React has some special props that start with on that can be assigned to a function which will be called when the event is triggered.\nHere's a few examples:\n\nonClick - the element was clicked\nonCopy - the clipboard is used to copy some text\nonKeyDown - a key is pressed down\nonBlur - the element loses \"focus\"\nonChange - only available for  &  (and a few others), triggered when changed\nonDoubleClick - the element was double-clicked!\nonPlay - a video starts playing\nonSubmit - a form element is submitted\n\nA full list of special event handler props is available here.\nJust like with addEventListener we pass the function reference to onClick instead of calling the function. Think of it like this: we give the function to React, so that React can call our function when the element is clicked.\n\n\n\nExercise A\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application from last week and open the Logo.js file.\n\n\n2. Add a function named logWhenClicked within the Logo component. (Hint: look at the example above).\n\n\n3. In the logWhenClicked function, console.log a message (it doesn't matter what the message is).\n\n\n4. Add an onClick handler to the  that will call logWhenClicked. (Hint: look at the ClickLogger component above).\n\n\n5. In your web browser, try clicking on the logo image. What do you see in the JavaScript console?\n\n\n6. In a group of 2 - 3 students, discuss what would happen if you changed your code to onClick={logWhenClicked()}. Can you explain why?\n\n\n7. Report your discussion back to the rest of the class.\n\n\n\nPassing Functions as Props\nSometimes we need to pass a function to another component as a prop, so that it can handle the event.\nA common example for this is a Button component. This component adds some styling to a normal , but still needs to be able to pass an event handler function to onClick. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nfunction ClickLoggerApp() {\n  function logWhenClicked() {\n    console.log(\"Button was clicked\");\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n      Then look in the console.\n    \n  );\n}\n\nfunction FancyButton(props) {\n  return (\n    \n      Click Me!\n    \n  );\n}\n\nNotice how this is very similar to the example above where we created the handler and used it in the same component? The only difference here is that we are passing the function reference through a prop. We could even pass it through multiple components as props.\n\n\n\nExercise B\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application and open the Logo.js file.\n\n\n2. Copy and paste the logWhenClicked function from the Logo component to the App component.\n\n\n3. Pass the logWhenClicked function reference as a prop to the Logo component. (Hint: look at the ClickLoggerApp component above for an example).\n\n\n4. In the Logo component change the onClick prop so that it passes props.handleClick. (Hint: look at the FancyButton component above for an example).\n\n\n5. In a group of 2 - 3 students, discuss what you think will happen when you click the logo image now. Can you explain why?\n\n\n6. Report back to the rest of the class what you thought was going to happen and why.\n\n\n\nRe-rendering components\nSo far we've seen that when the page loads, React calls our function components. The JSX elements that are returned from the component functions are turned into the DOM for you by React.\nTo be able to react to changes, we need to re-render our function components to get different JSX elements. React can then update the DOM based on the new JSX elements.\nLet's look at how a component is re-rendered (interactive version):\nfunction Counter(props) {\n  console.log(`Rendering. props.likeCount is ${props.likeCount}`);\n\n  return Likes: {props.likeCount};\n}\n\nIf you look in the console, you'll see that the component is rendered once when the page loads. props.likeCount starts at 0, so React inserts \"Count: 0\" into the DOM.\nWe won't look at how this works at the moment, but behind the scenes there is some code that will listen for clicks on the button and force React to update. That means when you click the button, the function component is called again (or re-rendered).\nNow props.likeCount is 1. React now updates the DOM to make sure it shows the correct number. Every time we click the button, the function component is called and React updates the DOM for us.\nWe don't need to worry about changing the DOM ourselves! This is what makes React so powerful. Even better, React will figure out exactly the right bits of the DOM that need to be changed, a concept called the \"virtual DOM\". This makes it extremely efficient and fast.\nState\nState is a general concept in software engineering. It is used when a part of your app needs to \"remember\" something that changes when people interact with it.\n\nThis is a simple example, but if we had lots of bits of state, then we can make very complex apps.\nReact Hooks\nReact has built-in functionality for initialising and updating state in our components. We will access state via a React Hook called useState.\nHooks are a new-ish feature in React. You may find older tutorials that don't use Hooks, but don't panic. The concepts we learn here are the same whether or not you use Hooks. We are looking at Hooks first because they are simpler to learn for beginners.\nImporting useState\nTo be able to access the useState Hook, we first need to import it from the React package. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nconsole.log(useState)\n\nIf we look at the console, useState is just a function. It lives inside the React code that you installed when you created the app.\nTo reference the useState function in our component, we need to import it from the React code. The curly braces around useState are a bit like writing:\nimport React from 'react';\nlet useState = React.useState;\n\nIn fact we can just write React.useState in our component if we want! But to type a bit less code, we import it (using the curly braces) once and then can just use useState.\nUsing useState\nNow let's look at how we can use the useState Hook (interactive example):\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return You clicked {count} times;\n}\n\nLet's break this down into small pieces. First, let's look at calling the useState function:\nuseState(0)\n\nThis initialises the state variable to 0. Any parameter passed to useState will be used as the initial value.\nNext, let's look at how we render the state variable in our component:\nreturn You clicked {count} times;\n\ncount is just a variable, so to insert it into our JSX we treat it like any other variable: we use curly braces.\nFinally, let's at how we get hold of the count variable:\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\nTo fully understand this bit of code, we first have to understand destructuring. Let's look at this blog post by Wes Bos about array destructuring.\nNow we can understand that useState is returning an array, with two items. The first item in the array is the current value of the count state. In our example it will be 0 on the first render.\nThe second item in the array is a function that we will use to update our state.\n\nNote: You can call the 2nd item in the useState array what you like, but it is widely accepted practice to name it set + the state variable name. Example: setCount, or setUserIsLoggedIn\n\nUpdating State\nOur Counter isn't very useful right now! Let's make it more useful by getting count to actually count up (interactive example):\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function incrementCount() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      Click me\n      You clicked {count} times\n    \n  );\n}\n\nOur component now has a , which will call the incrementCount function when clicked:\nClick me\n\nThe incrementCount function then calculates the new state by adding 1 onto the current count. And then calls setCount to set the new state:\nfunction incrementCount() {\n  setCount(count + 1);\n}\n\nsetCount does two things. First, it updates the state that our component is \"remembering\". Whatever you pass as the argument to setCount will be remembered as the new state.\nIt also tells React that the old state that is still shown in the DOM is outdated and so the DOM needs to change. Because of this, React will re-render all of our components to figure out what to change in the DOM.\nWhen re-rendering, useState now gives us the updated state:\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  ...\n}\n\nOn the second render, count is now set to 1. Every time we click the button, the whole cycle starts again.\n\n\n\nExercise C\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application and open the CaughtPokemon.js file.\n\n\n2. Create a new state variable called totalCaught and initialise it to 0\n\n\n3. When you create the totalCaught state, you should also set the function that will update this state (hint: refer to the syntax of the useState hook).\n\n\n4. Replace the number 0 in the JSX with your new totalCaught state.\n\n\n\nDon't mutate State\nAs we just learned, setCount updates the state for us, but it also notifies React of changes. Because of this we can't change (or mutate) state variables ourselves. In fact, React makes it impossible to modify (or mutate) state (interactive example):\nfunction Counter() {\n  let [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    count = count + 1;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      Count: {count}\n      Click\n    \n  );\n}\n\nClicking the button doesn't do anything! React is letting us know that we have to use setCount to be able to update state.\nWhere does State live?\nWe have talked about how a component \"remembers\" state. In fact, each component instance remembers separate state from other components. This means we can have multiple different Counters, each with a different state (interactive example):\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nSetting multiple States\nSo far we've only seen an example with one state variable. But you can create multiple state variables if you want! Let's see an example (interactive example):\nfunction FruitCounter() {\n  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState(\"bananas\");\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleOrangesClick() {\n    setFruit(\"oranges\");\n  }\n  function handleBananasClick() {\n    setFruit(\"bananas\");\n  }\n\n  function incrementCount() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n        Pick a fruit:\n        Oranges\n        Bananas\n      \n      \n        We have {count} {fruit}\n      \n      Increment\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\n\n\nExercise D\n\n\n\n\n1. Back in the CaughtPokemon.js file in your pokedex app\n\n\n2. Add a button to the component with an onClick handler that calls a function called incrementTotal.\n\n\n3. What do you think will happen when the button is clicked? Why is that?\n\n\n4. Using the fruits example above, make changes to the CaughtPokemon component so that the totalCaught state is increased by 1 on each click. Click here if you are stuck.The incrementTotal function you created gets called onClick, but so far, it doesn't actually do anything. To fix this, incrementTotal will need to call the function you set when you created the totalCaught state (the 2nd item in the useState array).\n\n\n\nWhen do you use Props or State?\nWe've looked at the 2 main ways of managing data in our React components. But when should we use props and when should we use state?\nRemember that props are like \"arguments\" to a component. It's good practice to make sure that you don't modify arguments after you receive them. Just like state, React prevents you from mutating them. Let's have a look at an example (interactive example):\nfunction Greeting(props) {\n  function handleThing() {\n    props.name = \"Mozart\";\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      Hello {props.name}\n      Click me\n    \n  );\n}\n\nWhen you click the button, you might expect the name prop to change to \"Mozart\". But it doesn't! React has made props read-only, which is a reminder that we shouldn't change props.\nIf we were allowed to change props, React doesn't have a way of telling that we've changed the data. Our UI is now stale - not up-to-date with the latest data - and has no way of knowing that it has to re-render.\nFrom this we can get a clue about when to use state. If data changes over time, then we need to use state. My rule of thumb is that I always use props until I know that it needs to change over time, then I convert it to state.\nFetching Data in React\nOften when you create a React app, you will want to get data from an API, and display it inside your components.\nHow do we do this in React? Where does the API call go, and when should we trigger it?\nWhere: Usually in a parent component, at the top of the component tree (see the note about 'container' components above). You can then flow the data down into your child components as props.\nWhen: When the component is first loaded into the DOM. We call this 'mounting'.\nHow: With a handy new hook called useEffect.\nThe useEffect Hook\nJust like useState, the useEffect hook is a special function that all function components can import and use as needed. This is the syntax to follow to fetch data when the component is first mounted:\nuseEffect(() => {\n  // Make your fetch API call here\n}, []); // Don't forget the empty array here!\n\nAnd here is a more complete example (see interactive example):\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\"; // remember to import the Hook(s) you need!\n\nfunction MartianPhotoFetcher() {\n  const [marsPhotos, setMarsPhotos] = useState({});\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch(\n      `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3&api_key=DEMO_KEY`\n    )\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(data => setMarsPhotos(data));\n  }, []);\n\n    if (marsPhotos.photos) {\n      return (\n        \n          {marsPhotos.photos.map((photo, index) => {\n              return (\n                \n              )\n          })}\n        \n      )\n    } else {\n      return Loading...\n    }\n}\n\nexport default MartianPhotoFetcher;\n\nIn the code above, we're saying to React “When this component is mounted, call the NASA photos API, and when you receive a response, save it inside of the 'marsPhotos' state”.\nThis is a very common pattern which will come in very useful!\n\n\n\nExercise E\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application again and open the src/BestPokemon.js file.\n\n\n2. Add a new component inside src/BestPokemon.js called BestPokemonFetcher.\n\n\n3. Change the export default to export BestPokemonFetcher instead of BestPokemon. We don't need to make any changes to the BestPokemon component.\n\n\n4. In the new BestPokemonFetcher component, create a new state variable called bestPokemon and initialise it to null. Click here if you are stuck.Look at the State section to see how to create state variables.\n\n\n5. If there is no bestPokemon state (hint: if (!bestPokemon) {}), then return null so that the component renders nothing.\n\n\n6. If there is some bestPokemon state (else {}), then render the BestPokemon component and pass the bestPokemon state variable as the pokemon prop (hint: ).\n\n\n7. Now add a useEffect to the BestPokemonFetcher component. Make sure you remember to add the empty array after the callback function. Click here if you are stuck.Look at the examples above to see how to add useEffect.\n\n\n8. Inside the useEffect callback, call the fetch function with this URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/.\n\n\n9. Add a .then handler into the fetch function (remember this needs to come immediately after the fetch call) which converts the response from JSON (hint: .then(res => res.json())).\n\n\n10. Add a second .then handler after the one we just added, where the callback function will receive an argument called data.\n\n\n11. Within the second .then callback function, log out the data that we just received (hint: console.log(data)). Inspect the data in the dev tools console. Can you see any interesting values? (Hint: think about what the BestPokemon component expects as a prop)\n\n\n12. Still within the second .then callback function, update the bestPokemon state variable. Click here if you are stuck.Refer to the State section again to see how to set state variables to new values.\n\n\n13. What happens in your browser? Do you understand why? If not, discuss it with another student. If you are both stuck, ask a Teaching Assistant.\n\n\n\nA note on conditional rendering\nIn the MartianPhotoFetch component above, we have wrapped our JSX inside an if / else statement. This is common practice in React, as it allows us to show something different depending on the situation (for example if there is no data to display, show the user something else instead). \nThe syntax above is correct, but you may also see this done in 2 other ways:\nThe ternary operator  ? :\nThe ternary operator  follows this structure condition ? output1 : output2.\nThe double ampersand &&\nThe double ampersand && is used when you don't have an else. The implication is that when the condition is not fulfilled, nothing will render. \nLet's see what that looks like in our component:\nwith the ternary operator:\n    return (\n      marsPhotos.photos ? (\n          \n            {marsPhotos.photos.map((photo, index) => {\n                return (\n                  \n                )\n            })}\n          \n      ) : (\n        Loading...\n      )\n    )\n\nwith &&:\n    return (\n      marsPhotos.photos && (\n          \n            {marsPhotos.photos.map((photo, index) => {\n                return (\n                  \n                )\n            })}\n          \n      )\n    )\n\nYou'll notice in the && example above, we do not render a 'Loading...' message, because there is no alternative output (no 'else').\n\n\n\nExercise F\n\n\n\n\nGo back to the BesPokemon.js file\n\n\nChange the if / else statement in your JSX to use the ternary operator instead\n\n\n\nContainer components\nIn real world applications, the things we want to remember in state follow the business logic required by our users. So for example the number of caught Pokemon in the exercise increases when you click on the button Catch Pokemon. Most of the time, business logic is about figuring out when and how to change state.\nTo help us cleanly split up code that performs business logic from code that shows the user interface, we split components into presentational and container components. Often we have components that don't do anything except manage state according to the business rules and render the right presentational components. On the other hand, we often have components that don't change any state, and just render using the provided props.\nContainer components usually have some state and handler methods, while presentational components usually just receive props and render JSX using these props.\n\n\n\nExercise G\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at the componenets in your Pokedex app - can you identify a good use case for a 'container' component? What about 'presentational' components?\n\n\nDiscuss this with another student.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\nArray Destructuring\nWhat happens if you forget to pass a prop to a component? Or if you pass the wrong type of data to a component? Sometimes React will just render an empty element but sometimes it could throw an error! This is why propTypes are useful. This page on the React documentation describes how to use propTypes in more detail.\n\nExercise H\nComplete the FreeCodeCamp exercise on propTypes:\n\nUse PropTypes to Define the Props You Expect\n\n\n\nIf you haven't already, complete the in-class exercises on your pokedex app\nComplete all of the lesson 2 exercises in the cyf-hotel-react project\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\nFinish reading the official React tutorial\nRead the lifecycle page on the official React documentation\nRead the AJAX page on the official React documentation\nWatch this video tutorial on fetching data in React\n\n"},"react/week-3/lesson.html":{"url":"react/week-3/lesson.html","title":"Week 3 - Fetching Data","keywords":"","body":"React - Week 3\n\nTeaching this lesson?\nRead the Mentors Notes here\n\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nRecap\nUpdating Data Fetching when Props Change\nWorking with forms in React\n\n\nLearning Objectives - React Week 3\nData fetching (advanced)\n\nAllow effects to update in response to prop changes\nExplain why a component with an effect dependent on props is broken with empty useEffect() dependencies ([])\nBe able to fix a component with an effect dependent on props using the useEffect() dependencies\nCan describe the \"lifecycle\" of a component with useEffect() when props change\n\n\n\nForms\n\nCreate a simple form in React using the controlled component pattern\nCan initialise state with useState()\nBe able to set the input value to the state variable\nCan explain why the input does not change when typing if onChange is not set\nBe able to update the state using an onChange handler\n\n\nUse data from a submitted form to update the application\nBe able to handle an onSubmit event to the form\nBe able to collect the form state variables and use them (setting state, POST request)\n\n\n\n\nRecap\nLast week we looked at using props and state to create React components that change with user input (interactive example):\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function increment() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      You clicked {count} times\n      Click me\n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default Counter;\n\nWe also looked at fetching data in our React components (interactive example):\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nconst MartianPhotoFetcher = () => {\n  const [marsPhotos, setMarsPhotos] = useState();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch(\n      `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3&api_key=gnesiqnKCJMm8UTYZYi86ZA5RAnrO4TAR9gDstVb`\n    )\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(data => setMarsPhotos(data));\n  }, []);\n\n  if (!marsPhotos) {\n    return null;\n  } else {\n    return (\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nexport default MartianPhotoFetcher;\n\nUpdating Data Fetching when Props Change\nLast week we looked at how we could fetch data from an API and render it in our React applications. However, there was a problem with the method that we learned before. To understand this problem we first have to understand the lifecycle of a component.\nThe Circle of Life\nLet's take a look at an example:\n\n\n\nExercise A\n\n\n\n\n1. Open this CodeSandbox.\n\n\n2. Take 5 minutes to read the code.\n\n\n3. Click the \"Fetch image for 2019\" button. If you're feeling confident: predict what is going to happen before you click the button.\n\n\n4. Now click the \"Fetch image for 2020\" button. What did you expect to happen? What actually happened? Can you explain why?\n\n\n\nTogether let's \"play computer\" to break down exactly what is happening with these components:\n\nWhen the page loads, the App function component is called\nIt doesn't have any date state already, so we initialise it to an empty string (\"\") with useState\nIt renders the 2 buttons, but because date is an empty string, it does not render the MartianImageFetcher component. Instead null is returned, which means that nothing is rendered\n function App() {\n   const [date, setDate] = useState(\"\");\n\n   ...\n\n   return (\n     \n       Fetch image for 2019\n       Fetch image for 2020\n\n       {date ?  : null}\n     \n   );\n }\n\n\nWhen we click the \"Fetch image for 2019\" button, the handle2019Click click handler is called\nThe state is set by setDate to be \"2019-01-01\", and a re-render is triggered\nThe App function component is called again\nThis time, useState remembers that we have date state and it is set to \"2019-01-01\"\n function App() {\n   ...\n\n   function handle2019Click() {\n     setDate(\"2019-01-01\");\n   }\n\n   ...\n\n   return (\n     ...\n     Fetch image for 2019\n     ...\n   );\n }\n\n\nNow App does render MartianImageFetcher and passes the date state as a prop (also named date)\nThe MartianImageFetcher function component is called for the first time\nuseState knows that we haven't got any imgSrc state so initialises it to null\nWe queue an effect, which will run after we render for the first time\nBecause the imgSrc state is set to null, we return null. This means that nothing is rendered\nfunction MartianImageFetcher(props) {\n  const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    ...\n  }, []);\n\n  if (!imgSrc) {\n    return null;\n  } else {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow that the component has rendered for the first time, the effect is run\nA fetch request is made to the NASA API (&#x1F680;!)\nWhen the request data comes back, we set the imgSrc state to a piece of the data, which triggers a re-render\nfunction MartianImageFetcher(props) {\n  ...\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch(\n      `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${\n        props.date\n      }&api_key=gnesiqnKCJMm8UTYZYi86ZA5RAnrO4TAR9gDstVb`\n    )\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(data => {\n        setImgSrc(data.photos[0].img_src);\n      });\n  }, []);\n\n  ...\n}\n\n\nThe MartianImageFetcher function component is called again\nuseState remembers that the imgSrc state is set to the data from the API\nThis time, we do not queue an effect. We used an empty array ([]) as the useEffect dependencies argument which means that we only queue effects on the first render\nWe do have imgSrc state set, so we render the image using the data from the API &#x1F389;\nfunction MartianImageFetcher(props) {\n  const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);\n\n  ...\n\n  if (!imgSrc) {\n    return null;\n  } else {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nPhew! That was a lot of work just to render an image! But we're not quite done yet, we still need to find out what happens when we click the \"Fetch image for 2020\" button:\n\nIn the App component, the handle2020Click click handler is called\nThe date state is set to \"2020-01-01\" and a re-render is triggered\nThe App function component is called again and the date state is set to \"2020-01-01\"\nThe date prop that is passed to MartianImageFetcher is different which means that it has to re-render\n function App() {\n   ...\n\n   function handle2020Click() {\n     setDate(\"2020-01-01\");\n   }\n\n   ...\n\n   return (\n     ...\n     \n       ...\n       Fetch image for 2020\n       ...\n       {date ?  : null}\n       ...\n     \n     ...\n   );\n }\n\n\nIn the MartianImageFetcher component useState remembers that we already had imgSrc state. It is set to the image from 2019\nAgain, we do not queue the effect because this is a re-render and useEffect has been passed an empty array []\nBecause imgSrc state has been set previously we render the image from 2019\n function MartianImageFetcher(props) {\n   const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);\n\n   useEffect(() => {\n     ...\n   }, []);\n\n   return ;\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise B\n\n\n\n\n1. Did you spot where the bug was? Discuss with a group of 2 - 3 students where you think the bug is.\n\n\n2. Report back to the rest of the class where you think the bug happened.\n\n\n\nThe key that the useEffect in MartianImageFetcher is only run once. This is because we told React that the queue should be queued on the first render only. However, as we saw, sometimes you need the effect to run again when some data changes. In this case the date prop, changed from \"2019-01-01\" to \"2020-01-01\", meaning that we have to fetch data different data. We call this a dependency of the effect.\nuseEffect dependencies array\nTo solve this problem, we can tell React to queue the effect on the first render and when a dependency changes. We do this by adding the dependency variable to the array (interactive example):\nfunction MartianImageFetcher(props) {\n  const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    ...\n  }, [props.date]);\n\n  ...\n}\n\nNow when the date prop changes, React knows that the effect must be run again, this time with the 2020 data. Because of this behaviour, the second argument to useEffect is called the dependencies argument. We use it whenever we have something in our effect that depends on a variable outside of the effect function.\nTo help you understand this better, try \"playing computer\" again, but this time think about what happens when we use [props.date] for the dependencies argument. Think carefully about what changes with step 6 after we click the 2020 button.\n\n\n\nExercise C\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application from last week and open the src/BestPokemon.js file.\n\n\n2. Copy the BestPokemonSelector component from this CodeSandbox. Then paste it into src/BestPokemon.js.\n\n\n3. Change the default export so that it exports BestPokemonSelector instead of BestPokemonFetcher.\n\n\n4. Take a few minutes to read what the BestPokemonSelector component does. If you have questions, ask a Teaching Assistant to help.\n\n\n5. In the BestPokemonFetcher component change the URL to use backticks (`...` ) instead of double-quotes (\"). Then replace the number 1 with ${props.pokemonId}. What will this do? Click here if you don't knowThe URL will contain the pokemonId instead of always fetching the pokemon with id of 1\n\n\n6. Open your browser and find the BestPokemonSelector component. Before you click the buttons, think about what you expect will happen. Then click the \"Fetch Bulbasaur\" button to find out what actually happens.\n\n\n7. Refresh the page. What happens now if you click the \"Fetch Bulbasaur\" button, then click the \"Fetch Charmander\" button? Is this what you expected? Explain to someone why this happens.\n\n\n8. Fix the bug by adding props.pokemonId to the useEffect dependencies array in BestPokemonFetcher. Remember that you can test if the bug still happens by refreshing the page, clicking one of the buttons, then the other button.\n\n\n\nESLint rules for React Hooks\nAs you may have noticed, VSCode highlighted the empty dependencies array when you changed the URL passed to fetch in BestPokemonFetcher.\nThis is because your React application is using the rules from eslint-plugin-react-hooks, a package created by the developers who make React. It helps you to find bugs in React Hooks code by highlighting places where you might be missing dependencies.\nIf you see a red squiggly line underneath your useEffect dependencies array, you can hover your mouse over and it will tell you which variable is missing so you can add it to the dependencies array. Here's an example:\n\nLoading state\n\n\n\nExercise D\n\n\n\n\n1. Open this CodeSandbox.\n\n\n2. Click the \"Fetch image for 2019\" button and wait for the image to load.\n\n\n3. Now click the \"Fetch image for 2020\" button. Do you think this is a good experience for the user? Explain what you think is wrong to a Teaching Assistant.\n\n\n\nIn the application above, the image from 2020 takes a while to load. This makes it feel like the app is broken: the user might think that they didn't actually click the 2020 button or that it is not working correctly. We are not telling the user that something is happening, it's just taking a bit of time to load.\nWe can fix this by adding a loading state. Let's take a look (interactive example):\nfunction MartianImageFetcher(props) {\n  ...\n\n  if (!imgSrc) {\n    return \"Loading...\";\n  } else {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n\nPreviously, we were just rendering nothing (by returning null) when we didn't have any imgSrc. We can tell the user that this by instead rendering something telling them that we're still waiting for the data to come back.\nThere is still a problem though: when we click to fetch another image, we still have imgSrc set to the previous image. What we could do instead is set the imgSrc back to null when we know that we're fetching another image (interactive example):\nfunction MartianImageFetcher(props) {\n  ...\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setImgSrc(null);\n\n    ...\n  }, [props.date]);\n\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nExercise E\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application again and open the src/BestPokemon.js file.\n\n\n2. In the BestPokemonFetcher component, instead of returning null if there is no pokemon, return \"Loading...\".\n\n\n3. Now add setPokemon(null) inside the useEffect callback, before the call to fetch.\n\n\n4. Try clicking on the \"Fetch Bulbasaur\" and \"Fetch Charmander\" buttons quickly. Do you see the loading state? (It may only appear for a flash, the Pokemon API is very fast).\n\n\n\nWorking with forms in React\nModern web applications often involve interacting with forms such as creating an account, adding a blog post or posting a comment. This would involve using inputs, buttons and various form elements and being able to get the values entered by users to do something with it (like display them on a page or send them in a POST request). So, how do we do this in React?\nA popular pattern for building forms and collect user data is the controlled component pattern. A pattern is a repeated solution to a problem that is useful in multiple similar cases. Let's have a look at an example (interactive example):\nfunction SimpleReminder() {\n  const [reminder, setReminder] = useState(\"\");\n\n  function handleChange(event) {\n    setReminder(event.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n      Today I need to remember to... {reminder}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nWe're controlling the value of the input by using the value from the reminder state. This means that we can only change the value by updating the state.\nIt is done using the onChange attribute and the handleChange function which is called every time the input value changes (typically when a new character is added or removed).\nIf we didn't call setReminder in the handleChange function, then the input's value would never change and it would appear as if you couldn't type in the input! Finally, the value we keep in the reminder state is displayed on the screen as today's reminder.\nIn addition, instead of just saving the value of the input in the state, we could have also transformed the string before we set it with setReminder, for example by calling toUpperCase() on the string.\nForm with Multiple Fields\nLet's have a look at a more complex example where we want to build a form to let users enter information to create a personal account (interactive example):\nfunction CreateAccountForm() {\n  const [userData, setUserData] = useState({\n    username: \"\",\n    email: \"\",\n    password: \"\"\n  });\n\n  function handleChange(event) {\n    const updatedUserData = {\n      ...userData,\n      [event.target.name]: event.target.value\n    };\n\n    setUserData(updatedUserData);\n  }\n\n  function submit() {\n    console.log(\"Do something with the form values...\");\n    console.log(`Username = ${userData.username}`);\n    console.log(`Email = ${userData.email}`);\n    console.log(`Password = ${userData.password}`);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        Create account\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nWe now have three different inputs named username, email and password, and we keep each entered value in state as a field in an object. The method handleChange is reused to keep track of changes for all the values. The trick here is to use the name of the  element to update the corresponding state.\nUpdating an Object in State\nDid you spot the strange syntax in handleChange?\nWe are using object spread syntax, which copies properties from one object to another. We are using this to update the state object but without mutating the original object.\nLet's break this down into 2 steps. Here we create a new object based on another object, and adding a new property (interactive example):\nconst sherlock = {\n  name: 'Sherlock Holmes',\n};\n\nconst sherlockAfterMoving = {\n  ...sherlock,\n  address: '221b Baker Street'\n};\n\nconsole.log(sherlock);\nconsole.log(sherlockAfterMoving);\n\nWe can also override a property if the keys are the same (interactive example):\nconst watson = {\n  name: 'John Watson',\n  address: '123 Fake Road'\n};\n\nconst watsonAfterMoving = {\n  ...watson,\n  address: '221b Baker Street'\n};\n\nconsole.log(watson);\nconsole.log(watsonAfterMoving);\n\nNotice how Watson \"moves\" from \"123 Fake Road\" to \"221b Baker Street\"? Because the address key is in both objects, the second one \"wins\" and overrides the other key.\nThe second bit of new syntax ([event.target.name]) is called a computed property name. Inside a JavaScript object, you can use a variable wrapped in square brackets which acts as a dynamic key, such as (interactive example):\nconst theKey = \"hat\";\nconst theValue = \"Deerstalker Cap\"\n\nconst sherlockClothes = {\n  [theKey]: theValue\n};\n\nconsole.log(sherlockClothes); // => { hat: \"Deerstalker Cap\" }\n\nWe are combining all of the concepts above to make a new object, that has all the same properties as the userData object, except for the property that is computed from event.target.name for the key and event.target.value for the value.\n\n\n\nExercise F\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application again and open the src/CaughtPokemon.js file. In this exercise, instead of recording the number of caught Pokemon, we are going to record the names of each Pokemon you caught.\n\n\n2. Render an  before the  (hint: ).\n\n\n3. Create a new state variable called pokemonNameInput and initialise to an empty string (\"\").\n\n\n4. Add a value property to the  which passes the pokemonNameInput state variable.\n\n\n5. Create a new handleInputChange function.\n\n\n6. Add a onChange handler to the  that will call handleInputChange.\n\n\n7. Add a parameter called event to the handleInputChange function and add a console.log with event.target.value. In your browser, try writing something in the . What do you see in the JavaScript console?\n\n\n8. Set the pokemonNameInput state variable to event.target.value. In your browser, try writing something in the . What do you see?\n\n\n9. We are now going to save the user input when clicking on the . Change the caughtPokemon state variable so that it is initialised as an empty array [].\n\n\n10. There should now be a bug in your app! The number of caught Pokemon has gone! To fix it, change from rendering caughtPokemon to caughtPokemon.length. Why did this fix the bug?\n\n\n11. We now need to change the catchPokemon function to add the pokemonNameInput state variable into the caughtPokemon array. (Hint: trying using the .concat() method, then calling setCaughtPokemon).\n\n\n12. Open your browser, type a Pokemon name into the  and click on the \"Catch Pokemon\" button. Can you see the number of caught Pokemon incrementing as you click on the button?\n\n\n13. Now we are going to display the names of the caught Pokemon. Instead of rendering caughtPokemon.length, create a  element and use the .map() method on the caughtPokemon state variable to loop over each Pokemon and return a  element for each.\n\n\n14. Empty the  after clicking on the button. To do this, set the state of pokemonNameInput to an empty string \"\" after we have added it to the caughtPokemon array in the catchPokemon function.\n\n\n14: (STRETCH GOAL) Make sure the user cannot add a Pokemon to the caughtPokemon state if the value of pokemonNameInput state is empty.\n\n\n\nHomework\n\nIf you haven't already, complete the in-class exercises on your pokedex app\nComplete all of the lesson 3 exercises in the cyf-hotel-react project\nTry to complete the Stretch Goal exercises in the cyf-hotel-react homework\n\n"},"react/week-4/lesson.html":{"url":"react/week-4/lesson.html","title":"Routing (optional)","keywords":"","body":"React 4\n\nIntroduction to React-Router\nIn the past few weeks, you've learned how to build applications with React and the different applications and examples were all built on a single page. However, what if you wanted to have different pages with each page having its own URL (so you can bookmark it for example)? You will need to introduce a router in your application. In JavaScript, a router is the piece of code which is in charge of switching between views of your application and keep each view in sync with a specific URL. For example, you could imagine having a homepage reachable from the root path / and a users page with the path /users. In React, a popular library to help you achieve this is React-Router.\nLet's look at a first example (interactive example):\nconst Index = () => {\n  return Home;\n};\n\nconst About = () => {\n  return About;\n};\n\nconst Users = ({ names }) => {\n  return (\n    \n      Users\n      \n        {names.map(name => {name})}\n      \n    \n  );\n};\n\nconst AppRouter = () => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              Home\n            \n            \n              About\n            \n            \n              Users\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n        \n         } />\n      \n    \n  );\n};\n\nReact-Router provides some default React components that you can use to enable routing in your application. First, notice the top level  component which wraps everything else. Each route is defined with the  component which maps a path (defined with the path props) with a React component. In the simplest case, you can specify the React component to map to the path with the component props. However, it is assuming you don't need to pass any props to it. If you face a more complex scenarios or if you need to pass props to your React component, you can use the render props which takes a function and return exactly what you want to render on this path. Then, the Link component can be used to create links to navigate to different routes.\n\nExercise A\nOpen the pokedex React application. In this exercise, React-Router will be introduced. Instead of displaying all your components in the same page, we will use React-Router to define  different pages in the pokedex application.\n\nIn the terminal, install React-Router with npm install --save react-router-dom.\nOpen src/App.js and import BrowserRouter, Route and Link components from React-Router (hint: import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from \"react-router-dom\";)\nWrap all the components in the render method in the  component.\nIn the following, we will have CaughtPokemon and BestPokemon displayed with different route. But first, let's create some links to navigate to different pages. Still in the render method of src/App.js, use the Link component to create 2 links: one to navigate to the URL /best-pokemon and another one to navigate to /caught-pokemon (hint: Best Pokemon).\nOpen the pokedex in your browser and verify that you can see 2 links on the page. When clicking on each of these links, the URL in your browser address bar should change (but nothing will change on the screen yet!).\nNow let's define the routes to map a path to a React component. First, create a route to map /best-pokemon to the BestPokemon component. Then, use another route to map /caught-pokemon to the CaughtPokemon component (Hint: depending on if you pass some props to BestPokemon or CaughtPokemon you will need to use either the component or the render props in the  component).\nOpen the pokedex in your browser and verify that when clicking on each link, BestPokemon and CaughtPokemon are rendered accordingly.\n\n\nURL parameters\nSometimes, parameters can be passed from the URL to a React component directly via its props. In this case, different URLs can be mapped to one single React component. For example, in an online shopping application, a React component Product may be responsible to display a specific product on the page. By using URL parameters, the name or ID of the requested product can be specific in the URL and React-Router will pass it a props of the Product component (interactive example):\nconst Product = ({ match }) => {\n  return Product: {match.params.name};\n}\n\nconst AppRouter = () => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n        \n          Product List\n          \n            \n              Laptop\n            \n            \n              TV\n            \n            \n              Teddy Bear\n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nIn the route definition above, a specific syntax is used to define the URL parameter: :name. Then in the Product component, the value of name can be accessed through the component props match.params.name.\n\nExercise B\nIn the following, we will create a new component to display a Pokemon information. The Pokemon name will be passed through the URL and displayed on the screen.\n\nCreate a new component PokemonInfo.\nIn src/App.js, create a new route which maps the path /pokemon/:name to the previously created component PokemonInfo (hint: ).\nIn the render method of PokemonInfo component, display the name of the Pokemon which is passed in the URL parameter (hint: use the props match.params.name).\nOpen the pokedex in your browser and try several URLs (such as http://localhost:3000/pokemon/Pikachu and see if the Pokemon name is displayed accordingly on your screen.\n(STRETCH GOAL) Instead of passing the name of the Pokemon in the URL parameter, now pass an ID. The ID passed correspond to the ID of the Pokemon in the Poke API. For example, the ID 1 corresponds to the Pokemon Bulbasaur (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/1/). In the PokemonInfo component, use the Pokemon ID from the URL to load the corresponding Pokemon data from the Poke API and display the following Pokemon information on the screen: name, color.name, shape.name, base_happiness and capture_rate.\n\n\nFurther Reading\nA lot of examples are available on the official React-Router website.\n"},"react/classes-optional/lesson.html":{"url":"react/classes-optional/lesson.html","title":"Class components (optional)","keywords":"","body":"React Class Components (Optional)\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nClass Components\nState in Class Components\nUnmounting\nClass Component Lifecycle\nFetching Data with Class Components\n\nClass Components\nSo far we have looked at components which are just functions (which are called function components), but there is another way of creating React components using the class keyword. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n\n// Class component\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      Hello\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// Function component\nconst Greeting = () => {\n  return (\n    Hello\n  )\n};\n\nInstead of getting props through the first argument of the component function, the class component gets props from this.props (interactive example):\nclass Mentor extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      {this.props.name}\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nHere are the steps to follow to convert from a function component into a class component:\n\nImport the Component variable by changing the React import to: import React, { Component } from 'react';\nCreate a new class that extends the component: class MyComponentName extends Component {}\nInside the class, create a render method: render() {}\nCopy and paste the contents of the function component into the render method\nReplace any references to props with this.props\nDelete the old function component\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application that you created last week.\n\n\n2. Convert the Logo component from a function component into a class component.\n\n\n3. Convert the CaughtPokemon component into a class component.\n\n\n4. Convert the BestPokemon component into a class component.\n\n\n\nWhen you should use function components or class components?\nClasses are an older method for creating components in React. Even though they are older, they will still continue to work for a long time. Because of this, there are many React components written using classes. You will likely still encounter them when developing with React.\nBefore Hooks were released classes were the only way to access state and lifecycle (similar to effects). The rule of thumb now is that new components should be written using function components with Hooks, but class components don't need to be updated.\nClass Methods\nClass methods are similar to nested \"handler\" functions inside function components. Let's take a look at an example (interactive example):\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Hello extends Component {\n  sayHello = () => {\n    console.log('Hello from Hello component!');\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      Say hello\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nUnlike nested functions, we can't use just the name of the function in the onClick prop. We have to use this first, because the method is attached to the class.\nNotice how we use a slightly different syntax for the sayHello method than the render method? There is a reason for this, but it is quite complicated and mostly irrelevant. The rule of thumb is to always use this syntax:\nmethodName = () => {\n  // ...\n}\n\nExcept for the render method (and a handful of others which we'll talk about later).\n\n\n\nExercise B\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application and open the Logo.js file.\n\n\n2. Add a method named logWhenClicked to the Logo component (hint: remember to use the correct syntax).\n\n\n3. Within the logWhenClicked method, console.log a message (it doesn't matter what the message is).\n\n\n4. Add a onClick handler to the  that will call this.logWhenClicked (hint: look at the Hello component above).\n\n\n5. In your web browser, try clicking on the image. What do you see in the JavaScript console?\n\n\n\nState in Class Components\nAccessing state in class components is a bit different than with function components. We're going to use the Counter component we looked at previously:\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function increment() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n      Count: {count}\n      Click me!\n    \n  )\n}\n\nNow let's look at the equivalent version in a class (interactive example):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    count: 0\n  };\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.setState({\n      count: 1\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Count: {this.state.count}\n        Click me!\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nThere's a lot going on here! Let's break it down into pieces.\nState initialisation\nUnfortunately, React prevents us from using useState inside class components and we have to use alternatives. To initialise state we have to assign a class property called state:\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    count: 0\n  }\n}\n\nThis creates a new state variable called count. Any value you assign will be the initial value of the state variable, so here we initialise to 0.\nUnlike useState, you can initialise multiple state variables at once, like this:\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    count: 0,\n    isCountingDown: false\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n\nDefining the increment handler function\nAnother difference in the class is that we don't define a \"normal\" function as the increment handler function. We also don't define it inside the render method, as you might expect.\nInstead we define increment as a class method (see above for a reminder):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  ...\n\n  increment = () => {\n    ...\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n\nThis also means that we have to change how we use the handler function in our JSX:\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  ...\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        ...\n        Click me!\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAccessing state variables\nSince we can't use useState, it also means that we don't have access to the count variable. Instead our count state lives inside this.state:\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  ...\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Count: {this.state.count}\n        ...\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nWe have just swapped count with this.state.count. Otherwise it works exactly the same.\nUpdating state with this.setState\nThe final piece is how we update state variables. Again, because we can't use useState, we don't have access to setCount. Instead we use a special function called this.setState:\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  ...\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.setState({\n      state: 1\n    })\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n\nThis function is similar to setCount because it does two things: \n\nUpdates the state variable\nTriggers a re-render\n\nOne difference is that this.setState can update multiple state variables at once:\nthis.setState({\n  state: 1,\n  isCountingDown: true\n})\n\nUpdating state based on previous state\nYou may have noticed that our Counter app isn't very useful. It can only count to 1! This is because this.setState has one more difference: if you need to update some state based on the previous state, then we need to pass a callback instead of an object (interactive example):\nclass Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    count: 0\n  };\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.setState(previousState => {\n      return {\n        count: previousState.count + 1\n      };\n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Count: {this.state.count}\n        Click me!\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can count up as much as we like!\nThis is because React can \"delay\" this.setState executing for performance reasons. By using a callback function, we ensure that we are computing the new state with the correct version of the old state and not an outdated one. This problem is one of the reasons why useState was created.\nRecap\nLet's recap what we've learnt about React state:\n\nWe initialise state by assigning a state class property to an object with whatever initial state we want (e.g. { something: 'hello' })\nWe can read or render state by using the this.state variable (e.g. this.state.something)\nWe can change state using the this.setState() method and by passing the piece of state we want to update (e.g. this.setState({ something: 'hi' }))\nIf we need to read the previous state to be able to calculate the new state, then we must use a callback function with this.setState() (e.g. this.setState((previousState) => { return { something: previousState.something + 1 } }))\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application and open the CaughtPokemon.js file.\n\n\n2. Set the initial state by assigning the state class property to an object. Then make the initial state have 0 caughtPokemon.\n\n\n3. Change the CaughtPokemon component to render this.state.caughtPokemon instead of hard-coding 0. Do you expect anything to have changed in your web browser?\n\n\n4. Add a  with the text \"Catch Pokemon\" to the CaughtPokemon component.\n\n\n5. Create an catchPokemon method within the CaughtPokemon class.\n\n\n6. Add a onClick handler to the  we just created that will call the catchPokemon method.\n\n\n7. Within the catchPokemon method, use this.setState() to change caughtPokemon to 1.\n\n\n8. Update the catchPokemon method to increase the number of caughtPokemon by 1 every time the button is clicked (hint: we need to use the previous state to calculate the new state).\n\n\n\nUnmounting\nSo far we've looked at components that are always rendered in the browser. However (and this is often the case in large applications), we might want to control whether components are shown or not. Let's look at a Toggle component (interactive example):\nconst Message = () => (\n  I'm shown when this.state.isShown is true ✅\n);\n\nclass Toggle extends Component {\n  state = {\n    isShown: false\n  }\n\n  toggle = () => {\n    this.setState((previousState) => {\n        return { isShown: !previousState.isShown }\n     });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.state.isShown ?  : null}\n        Toggle\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nIf you open up dev tools, you will see that the element changes based on the isShown state. The hidden element is not hidden with CSS, it is actually removed from the DOM. This is because this.state.isShown is false which means the Toggle component returns null for that part of the JSX. If you return null in JSX then React will render nothing at all.\nClass Component Lifecycle\nWhen a class component is within the DOM, we call it mounted. When a component is removed from the DOM, we call it unmounted. When we change state like in the unmounting example above, we can switch between these statuses. This gives us a clue that components go through a lifecycle of different statuses. We have seen 2 of the statuses: mounting and unmounting, there is also a third called updating.\nWe can hook into this lifecycle through special component methods that are added by React's Component class. They are run at different points of the lifecycle, often before and after they change to a different status. The method names contain will or did based on whether they run before or after a status change.\nThis diagram shows the React component lifecycle:\n\nLet's look at how we can use one of the lifecycle methods (interactive example):\nclass Lifecycle extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    console.log('componentDidMount');\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return Hello World;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex application that we have been working on for the last 2 weeks and open the CaughtPokemon.js file.\n\n\n2. Add a componentDidMount method to the CaughtPokemon component. Within this method add a console.log('componentDidMount'). You don't need to return anything from this method.\n\n\n3. Repeat the same step above with the componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount methods.\n\n\n4. Try interacting with the CaughtPokemon component in your web browser (clicking the button) while looking at the JavaScript console. What order do the logs appear?\n\n\n5. The componentWillUnmount method will never be called. Can you explain why?\n\n\n\nWe'll now focus on a few of the lifecycle hooks and see how they are used.\ncomponentDidMount and componentWillUnmount\nThe componentDidMount method runs after a component has finished rendering to the DOM. The component is now waiting for a props change or input from the user. It is called only once. We use this lifecycle hook to make changes outside of the component (sometimes these are called side effects).\nThe componentWillUnmount method runs when a component has been unmounted from the DOM. It is used to \"clean up\" the component as it is no longer being shown. Often we need to close down or cancel the changes we made in componentDidMount.\nTo look at these in more detail, we'll create a Clock component in an exercise.\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n1. Open this CodeSandbox.\n\n\n2. Now change the Time component (notice that there are 2 components defined in this file) add a componentDidMount method.\n\n\n3. Within the componentDidMount method use setInterval to call this.tick every 1000 milliseconds (hint: setInterval(this.tick, 1000)).\n\n\n4. Now open the JavaScript console your web browser. What is happening? Can you explain why?\n\n\n5. Keep looking at the JavaScript console and try clicking the \"Toggle time\" button. What do you think the problem is here? How can we fix it?\n\n\n6. Change the componentDidMount method to assign this.timer to the output of setInterval (hint: this.timer = setInterval(this.tick, 1000))\n\n\n7. Add a componentWillUnmount method to the Time component\n\n\n8. In the componentWillUnmount method, remove the timer by calling clearInterval(this.timer)\n\n\n9. Try clicking the \"Toggle time\" button again, like in step 5. How have we solved the problem?\n\n\n\nFetching Data with Class Components\nData fetching with class components is also a bit different than with Hooks. The problem is similar to accessing state, because we can't use useEffect inside our class components. Instead we can use the class component lifecycle.\nThe component lifecycle is very important - we don't want to be calling our API at the wrong time, or multiple times with the same data! If we tried to fetch data in our render method, it would make a request every time props or state changed. This would create lots of unnecessary requests. A similar problem is solved when using useEffect by the dependencies array.\nAs we saw above, componentDidMount is called only once when the component is first rendered and so it is an ideal place for making requests. Let's look at an example (interactive example):\nclass MartianPhotoFetcher extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(`https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${this.props.date}`);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // We don't don't what the img src is when we render :(\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n\nThis example isn't very useful! We can't use the data returned from the server in render because the request is asynchronous :( We need React to re-render once the request is resolved - a perfect use for state! Let's look at an example (interactive example)\nclass MartianPhotoFetcher extends Component {\n  state = {\n    imgSrc: null\n  };\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(`https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${this.props.date}`)\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(data => {\n        this.setState({\n          imgSrc: data.photos[0].img_src\n        })\n      });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can see the Martian photo that we fetched from the server!\nHowever we have a bit of a problem - when we first render the component, we don't have the photo src yet. We first have to initialise it to null. This shows us that we're missing something from our UI - a loading status.\nLet's look at showing a different UI when the request is loading (interactive example):\nclass MartianPhotoFetcher extends Component {\n  state = {\n    isLoading: true,\n    imgSrc: null\n  };\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch(`https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${this.props.date}&api_key=gnesiqnKCJMm8UTYZYi86ZA5RAnrO4TAR9gDstVb`)\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(data => {\n        this.setState({\n          isLoading: false,\n          imgSrc: data.photos[0].img_src\n        })\n      });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.isLoading) {\n      return Loading... &#x1F47D;;\n    } else {\n      return ;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nHere are the steps that the component takes:\n\nInitialise isLoading to true\nIn render, show a loading message because isLoading is true\nOnce rendered, componentDidMount will trigger the API request\nWhen the request resolves, we set the isLoading state to false and set the data that we want\nChanging state triggers a re-render, and because isLoading is false we render the Martian photo\n\nWe can still improve our component! What happens if we make a request that fails? Our request will error, but we won't show the error in the browser. Let's see how we can fix it (interactive example).\nFirst we have to deal with annoying quirk of fetch. You may remember that it doesn't reject the promise on HTTP errors. The fix is to add another .then before we convert to JSON:\n.then((res) => {\n  if (res.ok) {\n    return res;\n  } else {\n    throw new Error('HTTP error');\n  }\n})\n\nNow we can add our solution - a .catch on the fetch call. Here we reset the loading state and add the error to state.\n.catch((err) => {\n  this.setState({\n    isLoading: false,\n    err: err\n  });\n})\n\nNow we can check if there's an error in state and render out an error message:\nrender() {\n  if (this.state.isLoading) {\n    return Loading... &#x1F47D;;\n  } else if (this.state.error) {\n    return Something went wrong &#x1F62D;;\n  } else {\n    return ;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n1. Open the pokedex React application again and open the src/BestPokemon.js file.\n\n\n1. If you haven't already, convert the BestPokemon component to a class component.\n\n\n2. Set the initial state to have a key named pokemonNames that is assigned to an empty array [].\n\n\n3. Add a componentDidMount method to the component.\n\n\n4. Within the componentDidMount method call the fetch() function with this URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokedex/1/. What will this do?\n\n\n5. Add a .then() handler into the fetch function (hint: remember this needs to come immediately after the fetch() call) which converts the response from JSON (hint: .then(res => res.json()))\n\n\n6. Add a second .then() handler after the one we just added, where the callback function will receive an argument called data.\n\n\n7. Within the second .then() callback function, log out the data that we just received (hint: console.log(data.pokemon_entries[0].pokemon_species.name)).\n\n\n8. Now change the console.log() to log out an array instead, with the first, fourth and seventh Pokemon (hint: console.log([data.pokemon_entries[0].pokemon_species.name, data.pokemon_entries[3].pokemon_species.name, data.pokemon_entries[6].pokemon_species.name])).\n\n\n9. Now again within the .then() callback function, call this.setState() to set the pokemonNames key and assign it to the array that we just logged out (you can copy/paste it).\n\n\n10. Inside the render method, remove the old pokemonNames variable and replace it with this.state.pokemonNames. What do you see in your web browser?.\n\n\n11. Add an isLoading piece of state, which is initialised to true.\n\n\n12. When calling this.setState() inside the .then() handler, also set isLoading to false.\n\n\n13.

Its job is to send and receive data.\nLet's take a website for example. A website is just a collection of HTML and CSS\nfiles, images, maybe some javascript files. When you type a website address in\nyour browser's address bar, the browser (client) sends a request to the\nserver that lives at that address. The browser asks the server to give it the\nfiles it needs to display the website properly.\n\nNode and its ecosystem\n\nNode.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on\nChrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

For example, let's imagine that you wanted to log every request\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\nconst myLogger = (req, res, next) => {\n  const visitTime = new Date();\n  console.log(`visited ${req.url} at ${visitTime.toLocaleString()}`);\n  next();\n};\n\napp.use(myLogger);\n\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\nAs you can imagine it can be very useful to write your own Middleware, but you can also find many useful middleware to add to your program for rapid development.\nWorkshop\nFork and Clone the express-workshop-2 repository\nLet's have a look at the repo we've just forked.\n\nPackage.json: Remember how in the last lesson we added a package.json\nfile and added dependencies like express to it.\n\nWhat command did we use to create a package.json file\nHow did we add dependencies to it?\n\nToday, the project comes with a package file already - this lists all the\npackages we need to run the project (instead of adding installed packages to\nthe Git repo, which would take up a lot of memory, we just declare a list of\ndependencies in package.json). Now, we can run npm install, and the\ndependencies will be installed.\n\nServer.js - this is the entry point for our application. Let's walk\nthrough the code and remember what it does.\n\nWhat is Express Static Middleware used for?\nWhat routes are defined?\nWhat Port does the server run on?\n\n\n\nLet's run the server and check it in the browser. This is what you should see on your browser:\n\n\nThe theme used for this website is based on Bootstrap. You can get more open\nsource Bootsrap-based themes from\nStartBootstrap\n\n\nExercise: Notice how the link to Contact me doesn't return a page -\nLet's add an endpoint to return a simple string this is a contact page.\n\nTemplating\nOnce you have forked the repository, let's take a look at using templates\n\nExercise: Let's change the text displayed in the browser for the link, Contact me, to Contact Information.\nHow many files do you have to change? Wouldn't be nice if we could change one file and that reflects in all pages.\n\nAt the moment, we're just serving static HTML files from the public folder.\nNodeJS and ExpressJS allows us to build dynamic web pages.\n\nA server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled\nby an application server that processes server-side scripts. In server-side\nscripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page\nproceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nTemplate Engines\nA template engine enables you to use static template files in your application.\nAt runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with\nactual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client.\nThis approach makes it easier to design an HTML page, as it reduces duplicate\ncode (DRY).\nSome popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache,\nand EJS.\nHandlebars Templating Engine\nWe will use Handlebars as the\ntemplating engine for this class.\nTo add it to your project: npm install --save express-handlebars\nThen in your server.js, we need to configure the middleware for Handlebars.\n// Add this to the top of your file\nconst exphbs = require(\"express-handlebars\");\n\n// Then these two lines after you initialise your express app\napp.engine(\"handlebars\", exphbs({ defaultLayout: \"main\" }));\napp.set(\"view engine\", \"handlebars\");\n\n\nLet's look at the folder views/layouts/main.handlebars\n\n\nThere is a placeholder for body where the \"body\" get injected - can you\nfind it?\nNotice the index.handlebars, my-cv.handlebars and admin.handlebars.\n\nThen add these routes:\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  res.render(\"index\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add similar endpoints for /my-cv and /admin.\nExercise: Let's create a template called contact and delete the endpoint\nwe created earlier for /contact - render a view instead - similar to what we\ndid with the previous endpoints.\nExercise: Remember how we changed Contact to Contact Information?\nTry to change now Contact Information to Get in touch. Was it any\neasier?\n\nTemplate passing info from Controller to Template\nWhen we were using the static HTML pages from public/ folder - the heading\ntext shown on top of the page (on the photo) used to change when we go to\ndifferent pages. Now that we switched to the template, we've lost that behavior\nas the code for this part comes from the centralised Layout\n(views/layouts/main.handlebars).\nHow can we imitate that behavior without having to duplicate code or serve\nstatic files? Express and Handlebars allow you to pass data between the\nroutes and the views. Here is how we can do it:\n\nLet's modify the / route to pass the title of the page.\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  res.render(\"index\", {\n    title: \"Etzali Profile\", // insert your name instead\n  });\n});\n\n\nIn /views/layouts/main.handlebars, let's use the data we're passing to the\ntemplate\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      A modern Website built in Node\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Pass the subheading from the route to the view as well.\nExercise: Change Title to default to \"My Profile\" if no title was\nprovided. Look at #if helpers for Handlebars\nhttp://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html\n\nPartials\nHandlebars allows for template reuse through partials. Partials are normal\nHandlebars templates that may be called directly by other templates.\n(Handlebars documentation)\nLet's put the Menu in a partial.\n\nGo to layout/main.handlebars and cut the  with all its contents, and\nmove it to a new file called menu.handlebars under views/partials.\n\nThen to use the partial, add  {{> menu}}  in the place where you cut the\noriginal menu from.\nMore Templating\nThere is much more that can be done with Handlebars templating engine. Skim\nthrough the express-handlebars\nand handlebars documentation\nFor now, we will finish by using the each helper.\nDynamically loading the templates\n{{#each posts}}\n\n  \n    \n      {{this.title}}\n    \n    \n      {{this.summary}}\n    \n  \n\n{{/each}}\n\nIn the route, let's load the file in data/posts.json:\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  const filePath = __dirname + \"/data/posts.json\";\n  const callbackFunction = (error, file) => {\n    // we call .toString() to turn the file buffer to a String\n    const fileData = file.toString();\n    // we use JSON.parse to get an object out the String\n    const postsJson = JSON.parse(fileData);\n    // send the json to the Template to render\n    res.render(\"index\", {\n      title: \"Etzali Profile\", // insert your name instead\n      posts: postsJson,\n    });\n  };\n  fs.readFile(filePath, callbackFunction);\n});\n\nCallbacks\nIn JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. That means they can be used in\na first class manner like any other object since they are objects themselves. We\ncan pass them as arguments to functions which is common technique in JavaScript\nfor dealing with asynchronous behaviour. We have in fact already encountered\ncallbacks when we looked at array methods such as .forEach(), .map() and\n.filter().\nconst evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];\nevenNumbers.forEach((num) => {\n  console.log(num);\n});\n\nHere we are passing the function (num) { console.log(num); } function as an\nargument to .forEach() to execute with each item in the array evenNumbers.\nThe above example is synchronous which means that code the callback is\nexecuted immediately. Let's look at an example where the code is executed\nasynchronously. We will use a setTimeout function to delay execution here.\nIn most JavaScript applications asynchronous code execution could be in response\nto an event such as mouse click or data coming back from a server. We will look\nat both of those cases in detail in a future class.\nfunction delay(callback) {\n  setTimeout(callback, 2000);\n}\n\nfunction logRandom() {\n  const value = Math.round(Math.random() * 10);\n  console.log(value);\n  return value;\n}\n\ndelay(logRandom);\n\nKey points\n\nFunctions can be passed as arguments to other other function\nFunctions that are passed as arguments are called callbacks\nCallbacks may be executed immediately or later\nIf a callback is executed later, its return value is lost\n\n\nExercise: What other Asynchronous operations have we recently used in the\nNode code we've written?\nExercise: On the CV page, there is a button, Get Repos List, that\ndoesn't work. There is code to make it work at js\\github-client.js. Add\njs\\github-client.js to your pages.\n\nThe client-side code in github-client.js should look familiar.\n\nExercise: Identify all the callbacks in this code. Refactor the\nanonymous functions to their own variables and use the variables instead.\n(Bonus point if you use arrow functions)\n\nCallback hell\nIn the code where we retrieve the repos data from Github, imagine if we had a\nrequirement, that for each repo retrieved, we have to make another API call to\nretrieve all the available branches (there is a property called branches_url\nthat we can use to get that info). And then, once we have all the branches, make\nanother API call to get the info for each branch.\nThe code to do so, will look something similar to this:\nvar oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\noReq.addEventListener(\"load\", function () {\n  var oReq2 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  oReq2.addEventListener(\"load\", function () {\n    var oReq3 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    oReq2.addEventListener(\"load\", function () {\n      // 4. Now we finally have all the info we need and we can the info we retrieved from the three API calls.\n    });\n    oReq3.open(\"GET\", BRANCH_INFO_URL); // 3. third url for branch info\n    oReq3.send();\n  });\n  oReq.open(\"GET\", BRANCH_URL); // 2. second url for branches\n  oReq.send();\n});\noReq.open(\"GET\", REPO_URL); // 1. first url for Repo\noReq.send();\n\nThe code above is very hard to understand and follow. Notice the pyramid shape\n}) - This is often called the callback hell.\nAPIs\nAPIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for applications to\ncommunicate with each other. We already consumed an API earlier in the day:\nGithub API. We managed to communicate with Github and get important\ninformation. We - the client - can use this information in a number of different\nways. Our client, in this case, is a Web page but it could have easily been a\nMobile Application, or a TV setbox etc...\n\nLet's watch this video about APIs -\nWhat is an API\nExercise: Let's expose the posts.json as an API for other clients to\nconsume through the url /api/get-posts. Hint: make use res.sendFile\n\nREST API\nREST (REpresentational State Transfer) and RESTful APIs provide a convention and architecture for building APIs that is simple and scalable.\nThere are many constraints and aspects to building a REST API, but one\nfundamental constraint is the use of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and HTTP\nMethods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc..)\nIn our endpoint that we just created /api/get-posts, the get part of the\nURL is redundant as the HTTP Method GET already tells that we are GETting a\nResource. The Resource in this case is called posts.\n\nExercise: Let's rename our endpoint to /posts so that it follows RESTful\narchitecture.\nWhat would the endpoint for creating posts be called?\nWatch: What is a REST API\n(up to 3 minutes)\n\nREST is a big topic that we will revisit again. The table below from Wikipedia\nshows how a typical RESTful API would look like.\n\nWikipedia\nFor now, remember when building APIs, to use Resource names to identify your\nendpoints and make use of the HTTP methods (Verbs) to describe operations\nperformed on those resources.\nDeploying to Heroku\nHeroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that lets companies build,\ndeliver, monitor, and scale apps. Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and\nscale modern apps. Heroku is fully managed, giving developers the freedom to\nfocus on their core product without the distraction of maintaining servers,\nhardware, or infrastructure.\n\nSignup for an account on Heroku\nIt will send a verification to your email so make sure you've entered a\nvalid email\n\n\nDownload the Heroku CLI\nWe need to do a small tweak to our app to be ready to be deployed on Heroku.\n\nOn server.js, add the process.env.PORT bit of code\napp.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\nThis tells our server to look for an environment variable called PORT and\nuse it to run the server, otherwise use Port 3000. When the server runs on\nheroku, then Heroku sets the PORT to the correct value.\ngit add and commit your change.\n\nNow open the command line in the folder where you have your\nexpress-workshop repo running. If you run the command git remote -v,\nyou should see one remote origin pointing to your repo.\n\nRun these commands:\nheroku login\n\nThis will ask you for your heroku email and password that you used to\nregister.\n\nOnce you're logged in:\nheroku create\n\nThe heroku create command creates a new application on Heroku – along with a\ngit remote that must be used to receive your application source.\n\nIf you check git remote -v, you should see a second remote called heroku.\nNow push your code to heroku git push heroku master. The push will run few\ncommands from Heroku, then you should see a url similar to\nhttps://some-random-name-XXXX.herokuapp.com - go to the URL and if all goes\nwell, your app should be up and running.\nTo read more about Heroku and deploying Node Apps to Heroku, check:\n\nDeploying with Git\nGetting Started on Heroku with Node.js\n\nHomework\nAll of the homework for this week can be found in the Node Homework repository here under the Week 2 folder\nSubmission\nYou should fork the NodeJS-Homework repository, complete all of your work in those folders.\nMake sure you create a branch named [YOUR_NAME]/Week2 to separate your work for each week.\nEscalation policy\nWhen you get stuck during the homework you should follow the following:\n\nFirst, search for answers on Google and Stack Overflow.\nIf you have an error message, copy and paste it into Google.\nWhen you are stuck for longer than 20 minutes - no longer! -\nwrite a question to your fellow students in your class channel on slack.\nTake a while to think carefully about the question.\nThis is an important skill.\nHere is a great guide to writing good questions\nIf you cannot get an answer from your fellow students,\npost your question in your class public channel,\n@ the mentor for the class that covered the topic\nand we will reply as soon as we can.\n\n"},"node/week-3/lesson.html":{"url":"node/week-3/lesson.html","title":"Week 3 - Advanced Node","keywords":"","body":"\nNode - Week 3\n\nTeaching this lesson?\nRead the Mentors Notes here\n\nContents\n\nNode Recap\nBest Practices\nNode Process Managers\nREST\nSecurity\nAuthentication\nHotel Workshop\n\n\nNode Recap\nJavascript has evolved from the browser to be used in the backend.

It provides ways to store, retrieve and organize information.\nWhy do we need them?\nIn the past few weeks, you stored and retrieved data using files. This is fine for simple data but it can quickly become an issue as your application becomes more complex and needs to store and manipulate more complicated data. For example, imagine you want to develop the next biggest hotel booking application. You will need to store the list of hotels available for booking somewhere, and as you add more features, you will need to save users information, the reviews they post for each hotel, but also the bookings each user makes. You can see that the data you need to handle can become very complicated, especially when you need to consider that data are not static, as they can be updated or deleted. To work more effectively with data, we can then use a database, which present the following benefits:\n\nA database defines a structure for your data and the relationships between entities\nA database provides convenient and performant ways to safely store and retrieve data\nA database provides a mechanism to check the validity of your data\n\nDifferent types of database\nThere are many different kinds of database and different implementations. Sometimes, a database type is a better fit to certain use case or certain problems. The most well-known database types include relational database, key/value database, graph database and document database (also known as NoSQL). For this class, we will focus specifically on relational database as they are the most widely used and supported. You can consult DB-Engines to see a ranking of the most used database, as you can see, there is a lot of them!\nIntroduction to PostgreSQL\n\"PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of PostgreSQL date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of active development on the core platform.\" (source: postgresql.org)\nWhat is SQL?\n\nPronounced S-Q-L or sequel\nStands for Structured Query Language\nSQL is the standard language used to communicate with relational database\nSQL statements are used to query, create, update, delete records in a database\nSQL statements are executed by a RDBMS.\n\nWhat is a RDBMS?\n\nStands for Relational Database Management System\nIt is a program that processes SQL statements to manage a relational database\nPostgreSQL is a RDBMS.\n\nWhat characterizes a relational database?\nAs mentioned previously, a relational database is a specific type of database. Data is stored in tables of rows and columns as per the example below:\n\n\n  \n\n\nHow about storing everything in one big table as shown below? Why isn't it a good idea?\nA customer could have several bookings. If the customer changes their telephone number, you would have to update every single rows for this customer with their new number, which is more prone to errors. As a general rule, try to avoid duplication of data, and instead design your system in a way that you have a single source of truth for each piece of data. The example below is NOT a good solution.\n\n\n  \n\n\nDatabase modeling exercise\nScenario: You've been hired to create a database for a new company which wants to revolutionize the hotel booking market. The first task you've been given is to model how the company would store its data in a database. Here are your requirements:\n\nThe company wants to store in the database all the hotels available on their website\nFor each hotel, the company wants to record the name and the number of rooms. Also each hotel can have several room types and each room type has a specific price.\nThe company also needs to store the information of customers who registered on their website with a name, an email and an address.\nCustomers need to be able to record their bank details which consist of an account number and a sort code. Each customer can register several bank accounts if they want.\nFinally, as customers can book a room in an hotel starting on a specific date for a specific number of nights, the company wants to store the bookings.\n\nWith mentors help, model the database for this company. In particular, show the different entities, fields and relationships between each entity.\nCheck your PostgreSQL installation\nOpen a terminal in your laptop and verify the command psql -V returns the version of PostgreSQL. In psql, you can type use the command help to show the help menu. Within the command prompt, you can enter SQL statements and run them against PostgreSQL. To quit psql, enter the command \\q.\nCommunicating with the database using SQL\nAll commands in the following need to be entered in a psql command prompt. However, sometimes it's easier to write the code in a file and then load the file with psql. For example, if you write your SQL code in a file called test.sql, you can then execute it with psql -d DATABASE_NAME -f test.sql.\nCreating a new database\nIn a terminal, create a new database named cyf_hotels with the following command:\ncreatedb cyf_hotels\n\nThen connect to your database with:\npsql cyf_hotels\n\nCreating a table\nData are stored in tables. Let's first create a customers table to hold the details of customers.\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n  id        SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  name      VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,\n  email     VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,\n  address   VARCHAR(120),\n  city      VARCHAR(30),\n  postcode  VARCHAR(12),\n  country   VARCHAR(20)\n);\n\nFew things to mention from the SQL statement above:\n\nSERIAL PRIMARY KEY defines the column id as a unique identifier for each row. Moreover, this identifier will automatically incremented every time data is inserted. id is called the primary key of the table customers.\nVARCHAR(20) defines the column to hold text data with a maximum length of 20 characters\nNOT NULL defines the column as not nullable, which means that you must set a value.\nOther useful types include INT, TEXT, BOOLEAN and DATE.\nThe database will reject any values which don't match the type.\n\nExercise 1\n\nCreate the customers table in the cyf_hotels database.\nVerify that the table customers is created with the psql command \\dt which lists the existing tables.\nDisplay the table customers definition with the command \\d customers and verify that it matches what you expect.\nCreate a new table hotels in the cyf_hotels database with the following columns: an id, a name, the number of rooms and the hotel postcode. Use the commands above to verify that the table is correctly created.\n\nNow that we have a table to store customers and a table to store hotels, we can create a table to hold the bookings of customers for an hotel with the checkin date and the number of nights they intend to stay:\nCREATE TABLE bookings (\n  id               SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  customer_id      INT REFERENCES customers(id),\n  hotel_id         INT REFERENCES hotels(id),\n  checkin_date     DATE NOT NULL,\n  nights           INT NOT NULL\n);\n\nIn the above, customer_id and hotel_id are called foreign keys as they reference an id from a different table. This set a very strong constraint as you will not be able to create a booking for a customer id which does not exist in the customers table!\nExercise 2\n\nCreate the table bookings in your cyf_hotels database and verify that it is correctly created.\n\nInserting data\nOnce your customers, hotels and bookings table are created, you can insert data with the following SQL statements:\nINSERT INTO customers (name, email, address, city, postcode, country) VALUES ('John Smith','j.smith@johnsmith.org','11 New Road','Liverpool','L10 2AB','UK');\nINSERT INTO hotels (name, rooms, postcode) VALUES ('Triple Point Hotel', 10, 'CM194JS');\nINSERT INTO bookings (customer_id, hotel_id, checkin_date, nights) VALUES (1, 1, '2019-10-01', 2);\n\nThe data you insert should be of the same type with your table definition. For example, the following insert statement will fail:\nINSERT INTO bookings (customer_id, hotel_id, checkin_date, nights) VALUES (1, 1, '2019-14-01', 2);\n\nExercise 3\n\nRun the 3 SQL statements above.\nInsert yourself in the customers table.\nInsert the following 3 hotels in the hotels table:\nThe Triple Point Hotel has 10 rooms, its postcode is CM194JS\nThe Royal Cosmos Hotel has 5 rooms, its postcode is TR209AX\nThe Pacific Petal Motel has 15 rooms, its postcode is BN180TG\n\n\nTry to insert a booking for a customer id which does not exist in the customers table (for example ID 100). What is happening and why?\n\nRetrieving data\nPreviously, you have inserted data in your tables. How do you make sure these data have been inserted correctly? The following SQL statement is used to request data from a specific table:\nSELECT * FROM customers;\n\nExercise 4\n\nUse the above SQL statement to display all the data inserted in the customers table.\nUse the above SQL statement to display all the data inserted in the hotels table.\nUse the above SQL statement to display all the data inserted in the bookings table.\n\nRetrieving data with conditions\nActually, the SELECT statement is very powerful and you will see you can request a lot of different things with it. Have you seen the * character in the SQL statement above? It means that you want to see the data for all the columns of the table. What if you want to only return specific columns? For example, to retrieve all customers name and address from the table customers:\nSELECT name,address FROM customers;\n\nSometimes, you want to retrieve only data which verify a specific condition. In this case, you can use a WHERE clause. For example, to retrieve all hotels having more than 7 rooms:\nSELECT * FROM hotels WHERE rooms > 7;\n\nTo retrieve the customer name and address with id 1:\nSELECT name,address FROM customers WHERE id = 1;\n\nTo retrieve all the bookings starting after 2019/10/01:\nSELECT * FROM bookings WHERE checkin_date > '2019/10/01';\n\nTo retrieve all the bookings starting after 2019/10/01 for a minimum of 2 nights:\nSELECT * FROM bookings WHERE checkin_date > '2019/10/01' AND nights >= 2;\n\nTo retrieve all the hotels with the postcode CM194JS or TR209AX:\nSELECT * FROM hotels WHERE postcode = 'CM194JS' OR postcode = 'TR209AX';\n\nExercise 5\n\nExecute the file cyf_hotels_exercise5.sql which will reset your existing tables and insert more data in the customers, hotels and bookings tables. (hint: in the terminal, use psql -d cyf_hotels -f cyf_hotels_exercise5.sql).\nRetrieve all information for the customer Laurence Lebihan.\nRetrieve all customers name living in UK.\nRetrieve the address, city and postcode of Melinda Marsh.\nRetrieve all hotels located in the postcode DGQ127.\nRetrieve all hotels with more than 11 rooms.\nRetrieve all hotels with more than 6 rooms but less than 15 rooms.\nRetrieve all hotels with exactly 10 rooms or 20 rooms.\nRetrieve all bookings for customer id 1.\nRetrieve all bookings for more than 4 nights.\nRetrieve all bookings starting in 2020.\nRetrieve all bookings before 2020 for less than 4 nights.\n\nHomework\nAll of the homework can be found in this repository.\nSubmission\nFork and clone the repository above to get the homework for this week.\nCreate a new branch from Master to start working on this weeks homework.

Such changes include renaming a table, adding/removing a column, changing the name of a column, changing the type of a column etc... The general syntax to perform these operations is:\nALTER TABLE table_name action;\n\nFor example, to add a new column to the existing customers table:\nALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN date_of_birth DATE;\n\nTo delete an existing column from the customers table:\nALTER TABLE customers DROP COLUMN date_of_birth;\n\nTo rename the table customers into clients:\nALTER TABLE customers RENAME TO clients;\n\nFor more examples, you can consult the following tutorial: Postgres alter table.\nExercise 1\n\nAdd a column date_of_birth of type DATE in the customers table.\nRename the column date_of_birth to birthdate in the customers table.\nDelete the column birthdate from the customers table\n\nDropping a table\nTo delete the table customers:\nDROP TABLE customers;\n\nExercise 2:\n\nCreate a new table test\nDrop the table test\n\nUpdating a row\nThe general construction to update a row is:\nUPDATE table SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;\n\nFor example, to update the name and country of the customers with ID 3:\nUPDATE customers SET name='Bob Marley', country='Jamaica' WHERE id=3;\n\nExercise 3\n\nUpdate the postcode of the hotel named Elder Lake Hotel to L10XYZ\nUpdate the number of rooms of Cozy Hotel to 25\nFor the customer named Nadia Sethuraman, update her address to 2 Blue Street, her city to Glasgow and her postcode to G11ABC in one query\nUpdate all the bookings of customer with ID 1 for the hotel with ID 1 to 5 nights in one query\n\nDeleting a row\nThe syntax to delete a row is:\nDELETE FROM table WHERE condition;\n\nFor example, to delete the booking with ID 4:\nDELETE FROM bookings WHERE id=4;\n\nNOTE: If you don't supply a WHERE clause with DELETE or UPDATE the command will be applied to all the rows in the table which is rarely what you want.\nExercise 4\n\nDelete the booking of customer ID 8 for the date 2020-01-03\nDelete all the bookings of customer ID 6\nDelete the customer with ID 6\n\nJoining tables\nSometimes, you will need to retrieve data which are spread in different tables in a single response. For this purpose, you will need to join tables together. The general syntax is:\nSELECT A.column1, B.column2 FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.b_id=B.id;\n\nFor example, to load all the bookings along with customer data:\nSELECT * FROM customers INNER JOIN bookings ON customers.id=bookings.customer_id;\n\nTo load all the bookings along with customer data and hotel data:\nSELECT * FROM bookings\nINNER JOIN customers ON customers.id=bookings.customer_id\nINNER JOIN hotels ON hotels.id=bookings.hotel_id;\n\nTo load the booking checkin dates for customer ID 1 along with the customer name and the hotel name:\nSELECT bookings.checkin_date,customers.name,hotels.name FROM bookings\nINNER JOIN customers ON customers.id=bookings.customer_id\nINNER JOIN hotels ON hotels.id=bookings.hotel_id\nWHERE customers.id=1;\n\nExercise 5\n\nTry and understand each of the queries above in your psql prompt\nRetrieve all the bookings along with customer data for bookings starting in 2020\nRetrieve the customer names, booking start dates and number of nights for all customers who booked the hotel name Jade Peaks Hotel\nRetrieve all the booking start dates with customer names and hotel names for all bookings for more than 5 nights\n\nOther useful operations\nOrdering the result:\nSELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column;\n\nThis will sort the returned rows in the ascending order for \"column\". To sort them in descending order, use:\nSELECT * FROM table ORDER BY column DESC;\n\nLimiting the number of results returned:\nSELECT * FROM table LIMIT 10;\n\nReturning all customers whose ID is 1, 2, 3 or 4:\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE id IN (1,2,3,4);\n\nQuery by pattern matching, for example retrieve all customers whose name starts with Bob:\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'Bob%';\n\nYou can combine different operations together, for example, if you want to retrieve all the booking start dates with the customer names and hotel names for customer names starting with the letter M ordered by hotel name with a limit of 3 results:\nSELECT bookings.checkin_date,customers.name,hotels.name FROM bookings\nINNER JOIN customers ON customers.id=bookings.customer_id\nINNER JOIN hotels ON hotels.id=bookings.hotel_id\nWHERE customers.name LIKE 'M%'\nORDER BY hotels.name\nLIMIT 3;\n\nExercise 6\n\nRetrieve all customers whose name starts with the letter S\nRetrieve all hotels which have the word Hotel in their name\nRetrieve the booking start date, customer name, hotel name for the top 5 bookings ordered by number of nights in descending order\n\nIntegration with NodeJS\nIntroduction to node-postgres\n\"node-postgres is a collection of node.js modules for interfacing with your PostgreSQL database.\" - https://node-postgres.com/\nIn the following, we will use node-postgres to...\n\nConnect to a database\nSend SQL query to the database and get results\n\nLoading data from a database with a GET endpoint\nLet's build a brand new NodeJS application with a single GET endpoint to load the list of hotels that you already have in the hotels table of the cyf_hotels database.\nFirst, create a new NodeJS application that we will call cyf-hotels-api (enter server.js when asking about the entry point):\nmkdir cyf-hotels-api && cd cyf-hotels-api && npm init\nAs before, we will use the Express library to build our API, and the node-postgres library to connect with our database:\nnpm install --save express\nnpm install --save pg\nCreate a server.js file, import express, initialise the server and start listening for requests:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n    console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\nImport pg library and create a new GET endpoint to load the list of hotels:\nconst { Pool } = require('pg');\n\nconst pool = new Pool({\n    user: 'postgres',\n    host: 'localhost',\n    database: 'cyf_hotels',\n    password: '',\n    port: 5432\n});\n\napp.get(\"/hotels\", function(req, res) {\n    pool.query('SELECT * FROM hotels', (error, result) => {\n        res.json(result.rows);\n    });\n});\nIn the code above:\n\nWe first import the Pool class from the pg library, which is used to connect to a database\nWe create a new pool where we specify the credentials to connect to the cyf_hotels database\nWe then create a new /hotels endpoint where we use the method query() to send a SQL query to load all the hotels from the table hotels and return the results with result.rows. You can write any valid SQL query that you learned in the query() method!\n\nStart your server with node server.js and try to reach the /hotels endpoint to see the list of hotels currently available in your hotels table of your cyf_hotels database. You can try to create/update/delete hotels to verify that your API always returns what is stored in your database.\nHomework\nAll of the homework can be found in this repository.\nSubmission\nCreate a new branch from Master to start working on this weeks homework.

To start from a clean state for your cyf_hotels database, run psql -d cyf_hotels -f cyf_hotels_exercise5.sql.\nDuring the last class, we created a new NodeJS project called cyf-hotels-api with a single API endpoint /hotels to get the list of all hotels. In this class, we will add other endpoints with more functionalities to interact with the cyf_hotels database.\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\nconst { Pool } = require(\"pg\");\n\nconst pool = new Pool({\n  user: \"postgres\",\n  host: \"localhost\",\n  database: \"cyf_hotels\",\n  password: \"\",\n  port: 5432,\n});\n\napp.get(\"/hotels\", function (req, res) {\n  pool\n    .query(\"SELECT * FROM hotels\")\n    .then((result) => res.json(result.rows))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\nCRUD operations with NodeJS and PostgreSQL\n\"The acronym CRUD refers to all of the major functions that are implemented in relational database applications. Each letter in the acronym can map to a standard Structured Query Language (SQL) statement and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method [...].\" - Wikipedia\n\n\n  \n\n\nCreating data\nIn the following, we will add a new API endpoint to create a new hotel in the table hotels of the cyf_hotels database. As a reminder, here is an example of a SQL insert statement to add a new hotel:\nINSERT INTO hotels (name, rooms, postcode) VALUES ('New Hotel', 5, 'ABC001');\n\nAs we create a new record in the database, we will add a new POST endpoint in the cyf-hotels-api project from last class. Moreover, we need to be able to pass some parameters to this API endpoint such as the hotel name, the number of rooms and the postcode, so we can use this API to create different hotel. These parameters can be sent in the body of the request. To access the parameters in the body of the request with Express.JS, we need to add the module body-parser to the cyf-hotels-api project:\nnpm install --save body-parser\nThen include it in the server.js:\nconst bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\");\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\nWe can finally add our new endpoint to create a new hotel:\napp.post(\"/hotels\", function (req, res) {\n  const newHotelName = req.body.name;\n  const newHotelRooms = req.body.rooms;\n  const newHotelPostcode = req.body.postcode;\n\n  const query =\n    \"INSERT INTO hotels (name, rooms, postcode) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)\";\n\n  pool\n    .query(query, [newHotelName, newHotelRooms, newHotelPostcode])\n    .then(() => res.send(\"Hotel created!\"))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nWhat could go wrong with the code above? There is no validation of any user inputs which could result in errors, duplications or inconsistent data in the database! Here are few examples of things we can verify before creating the hotel in the database:\n\nCheck that the number of rooms is a positive number\nCheck that no hotel with the same name already exists in the database\n...\n\nLet's start by validating that the number of rooms is a positive number and if it doesn't, return an error.\nif (!Number.isInteger(newHotelRooms) || newHotelRooms \nThen we can validate the new hotel doesn't already exist in the database, thus preventing duplicate data.\napp.post(\"/hotels\", function (req, res) {\n  const newHotelName = req.body.name;\n  const newHotelRooms = req.body.rooms;\n  const newHotelPostcode = req.body.postcode;\n\n  if (!Number.isInteger(newHotelRooms) || newHotelRooms  {\n      if (result.rows.length > 0) {\n        return res\n          .status(400)\n          .send(\"An hotel with the same name already exists!\");\n      } else {\n        const query =\n          \"INSERT INTO hotels (name, rooms, postcode) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)\";\n        pool\n          .query(query, [newHotelName, newHotelRooms, newHotelPostcode])\n          .then(() => res.send(\"Hotel created!\"))\n          .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n      }\n    });\n});\n\nExercise 1\n\nFollow the above steps to create a new POST endpoint /hotels to create a new hotel. Make sure to add validation for the number of rooms and the hotel name. Test your new API endpoint with Postman and check that the new hotel has been correctly created in your database.\nAdd a new POST API endpoint to create a new customer in the customers table.\nAdd validation to check that there is no other customer with the same name in the customers table before creating a new customer.\n\nReading data\nWe already have one GET endpoint to load all the hotels in the database. However, we can improve this endpoint and add a couple of extra functionalities. First, we may want to order the list of hotels by name:\napp.get(\"/hotels\", function (req, res) {\n  pool\n    .query(\"SELECT * FROM hotels ORDER BY name\")\n    .then((result) => res.json(result.rows))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nAnother functionality which could be useful is to filter the hotel with a keyword to be able to search for a specific hotel name:\napp.get(\"/hotels\", function (req, res) {\n  const hotelNameQuery = req.query.name;\n  let query = `SELECT * FROM hotels ORDER BY name`;\n\n  if (hotelNameQuery) {\n    query = `SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE name LIKE '%${hotelNameQuery}%' ORDER BY name`;\n  }\n\n  pool\n    .query(query)\n    .then((result) => res.json(result.rows))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nIn some case, you would want to load only a specific hotel by id. Let's define a new GET endpoint to load one specific hotel:\napp.get(\"/hotels/:hotelId\", function (req, res) {\n  const hotelId = req.params.hotelId;\n\n  pool\n    .query(\"SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE id=$1\", [hotelId])\n    .then((result) => res.json(result.rows))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nExercise 2\n\nAdd the GET endpoints /hotels and /hotels/:hotelId mentioned above and try to use these endpoints with Postman.\nAdd a new GET endpoint /customers to load all customers ordered by name.\nAdd a new GET endpoint /customers/:customerId to load one customer by ID.\nAdd a new GET endpoint /customers/:customerId/bookings to load all the bookings of a specific customer. Returns the following information: check in date, number of nights, hotel name, hotel postcode.\n\nUpdating data\nWe can now implement an endpoint to update a customer record in the database. For this, we will use a PUT endpoint.\napp.put(\"/customers/:customerId\", function (req, res) {\n  const customerId = req.params.customerId;\n  const newEmail = req.body.email;\n\n  pool\n    .query(\"UPDATE customers SET email=$1 WHERE id=$2\", [newEmail, customerId])\n    .then(() => res.send(`Customer ${customerId} updated!`))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nWhat can go wrong in the code above? Again, there is no validation! We could set an empty email or even a string which is not following the format of an email. Remember, validating data is very important to make sure you don't end up with inconsistent data in your database!\nExercise 3\n\nAdd the PUT endpoint /customers/:customerId and verify you can update a customer email using Postman.\nAdd validation for the email before updating the customer record in the database. If the email is empty, return an error message.\nAdd the possibility to also update the address, the city, the postcode and the country of a customer. Be aware that if you want to update the city only for example, the other fields should not be changed!\n\nDeleting data\nTo delete a record from the database, we will use a DELETE endpoint:\napp.delete(\"/customers/:customerId\", function (req, res) {\n  const customerId = req.params.customerId;\n\n  pool\n    .query(\"DELETE FROM customers WHERE id=$1\", [customerId])\n    .then(() => res.send(`Customer ${customerId} deleted!`))\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nHowever, if you try to delete a customer which already has some bookings, the previous endpoint will fail. Do you know why? You cannot delete a customer whose ID is used as a foreign key in another table (in this case, in the bookings table). Let's delete all the customer bookings first:\napp.delete(\"/customers/:customerId\", function (req, res) {\n  const customerId = req.params.customerId;\n\n  pool\n    .query(\"DELETE FROM bookings WHERE customer_id=$1\", [customerId])\n    .then(() => {\n      pool\n        .query(\"DELETE FROM customers WHERE id=$1\", [customerId])\n        .then(() => res.send(`Customer ${customerId} deleted!`))\n        .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n    })\n    .catch((e) => console.error(e));\n});\n\nExercise 4\n\nAdd the DELETE endpoint /customers/:customerId above and verify you can delete a customer along their bookings with Postman.\nAdd a new DELETE endpoint /hotels/:hotelId to delete a specific hotel. A hotel can only be deleted if it doesn't appear in any of the customers' bookings! Make sure you add the corresponding validation before you try to delete a hotel.\n\nHomework\nAll of the homework can be found in this repository.\nSubmission\nCreate a new branch from Master to start working on this weeks homework.

At the end of this module you'll learn the following:\nTechnical skills:\n\nHow to build a complete full-stack application\nUnderstanding how each part of an application relates to each other\nWhat it means to work on a feature\nHow to work with GIT in a team setting\nHow to write readable code\n\nCommunication skills:\n\nHow to communicate effectively with team members\nKeeping track of your project's progress\nKnowing if you understand what's asked of you\nHow to communicate with non-developers about what you're doing\nLearning how to be solutions-oriented\nHow to work in a Agile setting\n\nObjectives\nThe final projects form the final module of the full-stack web development course, comprising four weeks following the completion of the last teaching-based module (currently the database module). The objectives of this module are to:\n\nBring together everything the students have learned so far (most projects involve a Node/Express backend with a database and a React frontend);\nGive an opportunity to demonstrate teamwork and a mix of interpersonal and technical skills that the students can talk about when applying for jobs; and Deliver something valuable for CYF or a partner organisation.\nAlso: nice portfolio piece; practice agile stuff; practical experience of junior dev role.\n\nProject team\nIdeally, the project team would consist of the following:\n\nFour CYF students;\nThree volunteer mentors, forming a balanced team; and\nA product owner.\n\nThe mentor group would include an engineer (responsible for unblocking technical/architectural issues, not an extra developer), designer (responsible for user research and UI/UX) and product manager (responsible for prioritisation and alignment with the product owner’s goals). This gives an opportunity to bring in volunteers from the broader tech community, and exposes the students to the roles they could be collaborating with in employment.\nThe product owner would either be a representative from the partner organisation or someone at CYF, depending on the project. It’s important that they are able to engage at least twice a week with the team, and have the authority to make decisions that let the team keep moving.\nWeekly plan\nWe’re going to run the final projects in weekly “sprints”, planning out what we’re going to do as teams and as individuals. Each week will therefore look something like:\n\nDaily standup: post a daily message in the team Slack channel to let the rest of the team know what you’re working on, what progress you’ve made (even, and perhaps especially, if it’s none so far) and share anything that’s blocking you1. Set a time for this and stick to it. Afterwards, post a team summary in the main class channel.\n\nMid-week check-in: you should have at least one Slack call with the whole team and a mentor during the week to sync on progress, escalate any blockers and make sure that you’re still heading in the right direction.\n\nSunday classes: we’ll continue to meet on Sundays, spending the time on:\nDemo: integrate all of your work together and share your progress so far with the mentors.\nRetrospective: what’s gone well this week? What’s gone badly? What are you going to do differently next week to make things better?\nUser research: show what you’ve built and what you’re planning to build next to potential users (other students, mentors, etc.) and use any feedback they have to improve your plans.\nSprint planning: decide what you’re each going to be doing during the following week and where you want to be by the next class.\nTechnical support: mentors will be on hand to help you get unstuck from any blocking technical issues.\n\n\n\nThe first and final weeks’ Sunday classes will be slightly different, so they’re detailed below.\nProject briefings\n\nGlossary\nAttendance register\nFeedback tracker\nQuiz app\nSlack dashboard\n\n"},"finalproject/firstweek.html":{"url":"finalproject/firstweek.html","title":"First Week","keywords":"","body":"Final Project\nFirst week\nOnce you have your team and your assignment, start by sorting out the basic administrative requirements:\n\nTeam name!

If you want to share your project with others, you need to\nhave a list of the things you installed, so that other people know what to\ninstall in order to run the project.\nIn Node.js, this 'list' file is called a package.json. The 'things you've\ninstalled' are referred to as dependencies. Creating this file is the first\nstep in setting up your Node.js project.\n1. Make a package.json file\nLet's start by creating the package.json file. We can add things to it as the\nproject grows. The package.json file is easy to create from the command line.\nType the following command into your terminal to get started:\n$ npm init\n\nThis command will initialise a step-by-step process for creating the\npackage.json. You should see something like this:\n\nIt will ask you a bunch of questions.\n\nYou can skip most of the questions but change the entry point from\n(index.js) to server.js.\nThe wizard asks you for the following information: name, version,\ndescription, main, test, repository, keywords, author, license -\ndo you understand all of them?\n\nAt the endo of the wizard, you should see a new file called package.json in\nyour project's folder.\nHere is an example package.json file for a project called\nPassport.\nWhat is JSON?\nJSON is a type of file for structuring data in a readable way. It is also a\nreally popular format for sending data across the web. JSON is a string\nrepresentation of a Javascript object. JSON objects convert really easily to\nJavascript objects, and vice versa, with JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify().\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"isAlive\": true,\n  \"age\": 25,\n  \"address\": {\n    \"streetAddress\": \"21 2nd Street\",\n    \"city\": \"New York\",\n    \"state\": \"NY\",\n    \"postalCode\": \"10021-3100\"\n  },\n  \"phoneNumbers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"home\",\n      \"number\": \"212 555-1234\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"office\",\n      \"number\": \"646 555-4567\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"mobile\",\n      \"number\": \"123 456-7890\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"children\": [],\n  \"spouse\": null\n}\n\nStep 2 - Installing Express\nBefore we write any code, you'll need to install the Express library. We're\ngoing to use the Node Package Manager (npm) to\ndownload it using the npm install command.\nNPM is the place to go to download other Node code written by other people.\nThere are thousands of open-source, 3rd-party Node modules (also known as\n\"packages\") by other people that you can download and use in your own projects.\nAs we install Express, we'll need to update the package.json to add Express as\na dependency. We do this so that other people working on the project will know\nto install Express before running any of the code. This can be done by adding\n--save to the end of your command.\nRun the following command in your terminal:\nnpm install express --save\n\nExpress should now be installed. Check your package.json file to make sure it\nhas been added as a dependency. It will look like this:\n\nStep 3 - Building the server\nThe first thing we need to do is build our server. You will always need to build\na server when writing back-end code. A server can be built in pure Node.js, but\nExpress gives us simpler syntax to work with.\n1. Create a server.js file\nLet's build our server! Before we do anything, let's create a new file called\nserver.js. This is where all our server code is going to live.\n2. require the express library\nWe already installed Express in Step 2, but we need to make sure it is included\nin this file specifically so we can make use of its methods. In Node.js, when\nyou want to access the functionality of a library or module in another file, you\nrequire it.\nTo import Express, write the following inside server.js:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\n\n\nWe will try and get used to ES6 syntax - so use const and let instead of\nvar.\n\n3. Initialise the server\nTo initialise our server, we just need to call the express() function. This\nwill create an Express application for us to work with.\nAdd the second line of code to your server.js file:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\n4. Start 'listening' for potential requests\nOne more step left, we need to set a port for our server to listen to. Think\nof a port as a door number; any requests that come to the server will come via\nthat door. Setting a port will allow us to find where our server is running.\nWe use the app.listen method to do this. This method takes two arguments:\na port and a callback function telling it what to do once the server is\nrunning. Need clarification? Read more about the app.listen method in the\nExpress documentation.\nWe're going to run our server on port 3000, and run a simple console.log as\nour callback function. Update your server.js file, calling the app.listen\nmethod:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n\nTry to use ES6 arrow functions instead of function.\n\n5. Switch the server on!\nYou've built your server, but it isn't running yet. We need to run a command in\nthe terminal to do this. We are going to use the node keyword to run the\nserver file.\nType the following command in your terminal:\nnode server.js\n\nIf you see this, congratulations! You have built yourself a server!\n\nStep 4 - Communicating with the server\nNow that we've built the server, we need to communicate with it. We're going to\ncontrol the server with handler functions.\nWhat is a handler function?\nWhen a request reaches the server, we need a way of responding to it. In comes\nthe handler function. The handler function is just a function which receives\nrequests and handles them, hence the name.\nThe handler function always takes a request and response object, and sends\nthe response back to the client along with some information. You can decide what\nto send back in your response.\nWhat does a handler function look like in Express?\nThe get() method is used to\ndefine a handler function in Express. It takes two parameters: the endpoint\nat which to trigger an action (we'll explain more about this in the next step),\nand the handler function that tells it exactly what to do. Here's a simple\n\"Hello World!\" example:\n// req is the Request object, res is the Response object\n// (these are just variable names, they can be anything but it's a convention to call them req and res)\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\nHere, we are telling our server to respond with \"Hello World!\" when someone\ntries to access the webpage.\n1. Create your own handler function.\nWe are now making a handler function with a custom message in our response. You\ncan write any message you want.\nUpdate your server.js file with an empty app.get() function:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Try to console.log the request object inside the handler\nfunction. Restart your server, refresh the browser, then go to your terminal\nto see what it looks like. You should see a lot of data come through.\n\n2. Tell your handler function what to do\nWe want our handler function to send back a message to the client. To do that,\nwe're going to use the Express send()\nmethod. This will update the\nresponse object with the message.\nUpdate your handler function like so:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Yay Node Girls!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n3. Check it out in your browser\nQuit your server in the terminal with ctrl + c. Then restart it to run your\nnew changes.\nnode server.js\n\nNow, open your favourite browser (we like Chrome), and navigate to\nhttp://localhost:3000. If you see your message in the browser,\ncongratulations! You just sent your first response from the server.\nStep 5 - Routing\nAt the moment our server only does one thing. When it receives a request from\nthe / endpoint, it sends back the same response: \"Yay Node Girls!\".\n\nTry typing http://localhost:3000/nodegirls and see what happens.\n\nHowever by making use of endpoints, we can make the server send different\nresponses for different requests. This concept is called routing.\nWhat is an endpoint?\nAn endpoint is the part of the URL which comes after /. For example:\n/chocolate is the \"chocolate\" endpoint. It's the URL to which you send a\nrequest.\nWhat is URL?\n\n1. Create your own endpoints and send different responses\nWe're going to try sending different responses at different endpoints. Remember\nthe app.get() method? To set up routing in your server, we just need to repeat\nthis method with different endpoints.\nFor example:\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.get(\"/chocolate\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Mm chocolate :O\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add some code so that your server sends one message when the\nendpoint is /node and another one when it's /girls.\n\nStep 6 - Serving static files\nSo we know how to send back a simple message. But what if you want to send back\na whole HTML page, or an image?\nThings like HTML files, images etc are known as static assets. If you want\nyour server to \"serve\" static assets back to the browser, you need to do\nsomething different than just using the res.send() method.\nTo be able to send any file from the server we need a special, built-in\nmiddleware function that comes with Express: express.static(). Read more\nabout it here.\nSay we want to serve all the static assets in our \"public\" folder. The\nexpress.static() function will look like this:\napp.use(express.static(\"public\"));\n\n1. Serve static files from your server\nDelete all your app.get endpoint functions, and replace them with the line of\ncode above. Restart your server, refresh your browser and see what happens! If\nyou see a Node Girls CMS, then your static assets have been successfully served.\nHTTP request methods\nAll requests use one of the HTTP methods. The main ones are: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\napp.get deals with requests that use the GET HTTP method.\n\nWe will go into these Methods into more details, but for now, think of GET\nas a method for Getting data. POST is for POSTing/inserting new data. PUT\nis for updating. DELETE is for deleting data.\n\nThe POST http request method\nWhen sending data to the server, we use the POST http request method, instead\nof GET.\nLet's try POSTing some text to the server.\nWe're going to add a form to the index.html page, so that you can write your\nblogposts from there.\nOpen up the index.html file in your text editor. If you have a look, you\nshould see this:\n\n  \n\n\nReplace the greyed-out comment with this code snippet:\nCreate a blog post\n\n  \n  Send\n\n\n\nThis form has a text area and a Send button.\nThe action attribute is the endpoint form data will be sent to.\nThe name attribute will be used later to reference the data.\n\nWhen you hit Send, the form will send a POST request to the server, using\nwhatever is in the action attribute as the endpoint. In our case it's\n/create-post.\n\nExercise: Open Chrome Developers tool, click the button and see what\nhappens.\n\nReceiving the blog post on the server\n\nData doesn't come through the server in one go; it flows to the server in a\nstream. Think of a stream as water flowing from a tap into a bucket. Your\njob is to collect this water in the server.\n\nIf we were writing a pure Node server, we would have to think about how to\ncollect the stream of data properly. But luckily for us, Express handles all\nof that stuff under the hood.\n\nAll you need to do is define a route to deal with requests that come through\non the /create-post endpoint.\n\n\nLet's remind ourselves of a simple GET route in Express:\napp.get(\"/hello-world\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Hello there!\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: This time we want to define a route to deal with a POST\nrequest not a GET. What do you think you would need to do differently?\nExperiment and see if you can define a route for the /create-post endpoint!\nFor now, make your /create-post handler simply do this: console.log('I am /create-post endpoint').\n\n\nExtracting the blog post\nNow the contents of your blogpost is hidden in your req object somewhere.\nNormally you would extract it using req.body. Try to console.log req.body\nnow.\nGetting undefined? Not to worry, that's normal. When data has been POSTed to\nthe server as FormData, we need to do things slightly differently to access\nthe data that's come through in the request.\nWe need another middleware function. Something that can get extract the contents\nout of the special FormData object. For this we will use express-formidable.\nexpress-formidable is another Express middleware. It will extract the form\ndata from the request and make it available to you when you do req.fields.\nThis time though, express-formidable is not built-in, we need to explicitly\ninstall it.\nIn your terminal, install express-formidable\nnpm install express-formidable --save\n\nrequire express-formidable so you can use it in your code. You can't use\ndashes in JavaScript variable names, so just call it const formidable.\nconst formidable = require(\"express-formidable\");\n\nNow add this towards the top of your server, after your requires and\napp.use(express.static('public')), but before your /create-post endpoint:\napp.use(formidable());\n\nNow inside your /create-post function, add:\nconsole.log(req.fields);\n\nRefresh your server and have another go at writing a blogpost.\nYou should now see an object in the console. The key should be blogpost, just\nlike the name attribute in the form on the HTML page. The value of blogpost\nwill be your message!\n\nExercise: Try putting app.use(formidable()); at the end of the file\n(after the create-post but before starting the server)\nWhat is a middleware in Express? Middleware functions are functions that\nhave access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the\nnext function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next function\nis a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the\nmiddleware succeeding the current middleware. Read more on\nthe Express documentation\n\nStep 8 - Saving your blog post\nRight now, your precious blog posts aren't being saved anywhere, which is a bit\nof a shame. Let's do something about that.\nYou'll note that in the data folder there's a new file called posts.json.\nIf you look at posts.json will see there's already one blog post there. The\nformat is:\n{\n    [timestamp]: [blog post message]\n}\n\nWe've used a timestamp as the key so that the blog posts are listed in\nchronological order. Also, it's a record of when the blog post was created.\nWriting to your hard drive\nAnytime a blog post comes through to the server, we want to save the data on\nyour computer's hard drive. To do this, we need to use a built-in Node module:\nfs, which stands for 'file-system'.\nBuilt-in Node modules - core Node modules - are rather like the built-in\nExpress middleware functions. Only difference is that where you need to have\ninstalled Express to use Express middleware functions, the core Node modules\ncome automatically with Node itself.\nTo use fs, you'll need to require it at the top of your server file:\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nThe method we need to write to your hard drive is fs.writeFile.\nfs.writeFile(\"path/to/file\", yourData, function (error) {\n  // do something\n});\n\n\nArgument 1: the location of the file you want to write to\nArgument 2: the data you want to write\nArgument 3: the callback function\n\nThe 'path/to/file' will be replaced with the actual path to the file you want to\nwrite to. If it doesn't exist, fs.writeFile cleverly creates one for you. But\nwe already have posts.json, so not to worry.\nReading from your hard drive\nTo read data that's already there, you would use fs.readFile. The way to use\nfs.readFile is very similar to fs.writeFile:\nfs.readFile(\"path/to/file\", function (error, file) {\n  // do something\n});\n\n\nArgument 1: the location of the file you want to read from\nArgument 2: the callback function\n\nYou'll notice that fs.readFile's callback function takes a second argument.\nThat argument would be the file you're reading.\nLet's read the data from the posts.json file. Make sure you've required the\nfs core Node module at the top of your server file somewhere.\nAdd this code to your server (put it anywhere after the requires for now):\nfs.readFile(__dirname + \"/data/posts.json\", function (error, file) {\n  console.log(file);\n});\n\n(__dirname is a Node global object that gives you a path to current working\ndirectory. It's handy if we want to avoid writing the whole path out in full.)\nIf you restart the server, you'll probably see something like this:\n\n\nThis is actually the contents of your posts.json file, but in a format called\na buffer. To make it a bit more human-readable, you can console.log the file\nto a string, like this:\nconsole.log(file.toString());\n\nfile is in JSON format right now. If we want to access the blog post message\ninside file, we need to parse it from JSON back to a JavaScipt object.\nAdd this next bit of code to your fs.readFile's callback function:\nconst parsedFile = JSON.parse(file);\n\nNow parsedFile is a normal JavaScript object, and we can access the data\ninside it.\nOk, so we've talked about JSON and we've talked about reading and writing files.\nYou now have the power to save new blog post data to your hard drive! Work with\nyour partner and your mentor to see if you can figure the next steps out on your\nown.\nHere's a breakdown of what you want to achieve:\n\nWhen new blog post data comes through, read from posts.json to access its\ncontents\nAdd your new blog post data to the old ones.\nWrite your new combined data back to the posts.json file.\n\nThings to remember\n\nfs.writeFile() normally overwrites the target file you've given it. Chances\nare you don't want to lose all your old blog posts every time you get a new\none, so think about how you can combine fs.readFile() and fs.writeFile()\nto prevent overwriting.\n\nYou will need to convert between JSON and a JavaScript object several times.\nJSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() are what you need.\n\n\nOh by the way, if you want to get the current timestamp, use the JavaScript\nDate.now() method.\nStep 9 - Displaying your blog posts\nSo now we're saving the blog posts to the server. Time to get them and display\nthem on the page!\nIf you look inside public/script.js, there's a whole bunch of JavaScript code\nin there.

Why not just use the file system?\nWhat would make a good database?\n\n\nWhy a database\n\nDatabases can store very large numbers of records efficiently (they take up\nlittle space).\nYou can have strucutre on your data\nYou can query for data in a database, you can sort data, add/edit/delete data\nYou can optimise a database to make searches (queries) quicker\nYou can relate pieces of data to each other to avoid duplication which makes\nyour information more reliable and less prone to errors\nACID\nIn computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is\na set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity\neven in the event of errors, power failures, etc.\n\n\nDatabases can handle very large data sets.\nDatabases are concurrent; multiple users can use them at the same time without\ncorrupting the data.\nDatabases scale well\n\nRelational and non-relational databases\nThere are mainly two flavours of databases used commercially these days.\nRelational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.\nRelational databases include MySQL, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle\nDatabase and many others. They've been around for a long time and they're used\nfor all kind of applications.\nNon-relational databases are relatively new and they include the likes of\nMongoDB, Casandra, Neo4j etc...\nMongo\n\nMongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database\nprogram. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like\ndocuments.\n\nBSON (JSON-like document)\nIn a Relational database, information is organised in rows in tables with\npredefined columns.\nIn a non-relational database, information is organised in documents. MongoDB\nstores data records in a format similar to JSON called BSON. BSON is a binary\nrepresentation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.\n\nLet's look at this database table Students containing information about\nstudents participating in a course \n\nExercise: What are the columns, rows and tables?\n\n\n\nExercise: Open https://jsonlint.com/ and write a JSON representation of two\nrows in the Students table example. Click Validate JSON and make sure the\ndocument is valid.\n\nAre there any alternative representations you can think of?\n\n\nBSON is very similar to JSON. It contains more data types than JSON, it also\nallows the field names to not be quoted. Read more information about the\nformat: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/.\nMongo Shell\nLet's go to mongo shell and start interacting with our database system.\n1. Create a database\nOn the shell, type the command use profile The shell should respond with\nswitched to db profile. At this stage, the database does not necessarily\nexist once we start adding information (collections) then the database will be\ncreated and the collection added to them.\nTo check the current database, run db.\n2. Create a collection\nNow let's create our first collection. Make sure you're using the profile\ndatabase. Run db and it should print profile on the terminal.\nWe will insert a simple document representing a student.\n\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Habiiba', country: 'Somalia', assignedMentors:\n['Ashleigh'] })\n\nYou should get a confirmation with the number of records inserted.\nYou can also insert more than one document at a time. Run this command\n\ndb.students.insertMany([{ name: 'Khalid', country: 'Yemen' }, { name:\n'Yohannes', country: 'Ethiopia', assignedMentors: ['Michael'] }])\n\nrun the command db.students.count() and you should get that you have 3\ndocuments.\n3. Querying data\nQuerying is one of the most important reasons that we use databases. SQL is the\nlanguage used for querying relational databases, In MongoDB, we can use the\nmethod db.collection.find, passing a query in the form of a JSON object as a\nfirst parameter.\nLet's try few queries:\nGet all the students from Ethiopia.\n\ndb.students.find({country: 'Ethiopia'})\n\nWe can also provide an extra parameter projection to define what fields we\nwant back from the query.\nFor example, if we're only interested in the name\ndb.students.find({ country: \"Ethiopia\" }, { name: 1 });\n// you can also use { name: true }\n\nLet's add another two students to the collection\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Sudan', assignedMentors:\n['Michael'] })\nand\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Syria', assignedMentors:\n['Michael', 'Ashleigh'] })\nNow let's query for all the students that have Michael as mentor.\ndb.students.find({ assignedMentors: [\"Michael\"] });\n\nWhat if we want to find any student whose name is \"Mohamed\" AND whose country is\n\"Sudan\". You can then use the logical query operator $and.\ndb.students.find({\n  $and: [{ name: \"Mohamed\" }, { country: \"Sudan\" }]\n});\n\nNotice that name and country are case-sensitive.\nExercise\n\nFind all students for whom Ashleigh is an assigned mentor.\nFind all students that have Michael as their only mentor\nFind students whose name is Mohamed OR Michael is their only mentor\nRead about the\n$in operator\nand use it to find students whose country is either Sudan or Ethiopia.\nLook at the other\nComparison Query Operators\nand the\nLogical Query Operators\nand use few of them.\n\nKey Concepts so far\nIn Mongo, a database contains collections that contain BSON\ndocuments. We can use the mongo shell to interact with our Mongo\ndatabases. The query documents are used to specify a selection filter using\nquery operators\nto search for documents in the collections.\n\nCheckpoint: Do you understand all the words highlighed in the last paragraph?\n\nNode with Mongo\nSo far we've been connecting to Mongo using the Mongo shell. Mongo has drivers\nfor most major programming languages but it's especially popular with NodeJS\napplications as its API and Query model is very close to JavaScript syntax and\npatterns.\nLet's start wiring Node with MongoDB as a datastore.\n\nFork and Clone the project\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop.\nrun npm install then npm run dev to run the application with autoreload -\nGo to the browser and make sure it's up and running.\n\nInstall the MongoDB Node.js Driver npm install mongodb --save\n\nLet's add an endpoint api/students that returns a json containing all the\nstudents that we've been saving to the database from the shell.\n\n\nGo to the file controllers/apiController, on top of the file, require the\nmodule\nconst MongoClient = require(\"mongodb\").MongoClient;\n\nthen add an endpoint for /students\nrouter.get(\"/students\", (req, res) => {\n  const mongoConnection = \"mongodb://localhost:27017/profile\";\n\n  MongoClient.connect(mongoConnection, (err, db) => {\n    const cursor = db.collection(\"students\").find({});\n    cursor.toArray((error, students) => {\n      db.close();\n      res.json(students);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nGo to your browser /api/students and you should see a JSON containing the\ndocuments we've added to the students collection earlier.\n\nExercise: Let's step through the previous code and understand it line by line.\n\nWhat is a Mongo conection string?\n\n\nThe connection string\nfollows this format:\nmongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]].\nWhat parts do you have in our connection string right now?\nExercise part 1\nNow let's change the api/posts to also use the mongo database instead of the\njson file under /data.\n\nFirst step is to save the posts in the database. Similar to what we did\nwith students collection, use the Mongo shell to create a new collection\ncalled posts and use insertMany to insert all the documents.\n\nChange the endpoint /api/posts to read its contents from the database (very\nsimilar code to what we wrote in /api/students endpoint). Go to\nhttp://localhost:3000/api/posts and make sure you see the posts. Update a\ndocument in the database (either check the documentation for\nupdate\nor use RoboMongo) and see if it gets reflected.\n\nOnce you have the endpoint running, delete the json data/posts.json.\n\nNow if you go to the root of your application http://localhost:3000, you\nwill encounter an error as it will still try to read from the file system but\nwe deleted the file. Update the / endpoint to also get the Posts from the\ndatabase.\n\n\nExercise part 2: refactor the code\nEven though our code does what's supposed to do, it has several issues. We have\na lot of duplicate code—both endpoints GET /api/posts and GET / do the\nsame call to the database and then do something with it. It's only that\nsomething (the callback) that is different so let's refactor the code to\neliminate duplication (DRY).\n\nThe variable mongoConnection is declared multiple times, that means that if\nthe connection string changes then we need to change multiple places causing\npossibilities of missing one instance and causing errors. Let's declare it\nonce and use it in the rest of the app.\n\nWhy is it bad to have duplicate code?\n\n\nExtract the Mongo calls to seperate functions. Extract the route for\n/api/students into a function named getStudents\n\nWhat will the function signature be?\nRemember the Single Responsibility Principle—the route handlers have\nmultiple responsibilities right now: Connecting to Mongo, getting the data\nthen sending it back as a response.\n\n\nMove the new function to a new file called helpers/db-client.js, export the\nfunctions and use them in the original file.\n\nDo you remember how we create modules and use them? module.exports and\nrequire.\n\n\nDo the same for the /posts\n\n\nExercise Part 3: Deploy our app\nLet's deploy our Database-Driven Application to Heroku. If you don't remember\nthe steps, refresh your memory from\nthe previous lesson.\nOnce you're finsihed, Go to your application on heroku and see if it is working\nproperly.\nIt should not be working.\nCan you have a guess on what went wrong? To see what's happening on the heroku\nserver, run heroku logs from the terminal and check the logs.\nMongo on Heroku\nHeroku, AWS and other cloud services allows us to use databases and other\nservices on the cloud without having to maintain physical servers making it easy\nto scale, monitor costs and build good solutions in general.\nWe've already used DynamoDB on AWS. This week, we'll do MongoDB.\n\nGo to Heroku dashboard\nhttps://dashboard.heroku.com\n\nClick on your app name in the dashboard. Go to Resources, under addons,\nsearch for mLab MongoDB and choose it. When you're prompted with this\nscreen—click on Provision.\n\nThe new MongoDB service will appear under Resources-you can click on it and it\nwill take you to a web interface to administer your MongoDB instance.\n\nGo to the Settings and click on Reveal Config Vars. You should see the\na variable called MongoDB_URI—that is the connection string for the MongoDB\ninstance on Heroku (on mLab used by Heroku).\n\nSo how can we use this connection string instead of our local one?\n\n\n\nEnvironment variables\nIn NodeJS, The process.env property returns an object containing the user\nenvironment. Environment variables allow us to configure different aspects of\nour application based on the environment where it's running—so for instance,\nwhen we run our application locally, we want to connect to the local MongoDB but\non Heroku, we want to connect to a different one.\nConnection strings are typically saved and used as Environment variables, other\ntypical uses are with passwords, secrets, URLs of other services etc... Anything\nthat is environment specific and that shouldn't live in the source code.\n\nSecurity tip: Never add passwords, connection strings or any sensitive\ninformation in your source code, always use an Environment variable.\n\nServices like Heroku and AWS can then use these environment variables to\nconfigure aspects of the application.\n\nWe've already used one Environment variable for Heroku before—what was it?\nExercise: Use the environment MongoDB_URI to connect to MongoDB on Heroku,\nbut fallback to localhost connection string if there is no environment\nvariable provided.\n\n\nCommit and push the changes to Heroku and see if it works.\n\nHomework\nRefer to the MongoDB/Node workshop for the Homework tasks -\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop\n\nRead https://www.upguard.com/articles/mysql-vs-mongodb\n\nResources\n\nWhy use a database:\nhttps://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/190482/why-use-a-database-instead-of-just-saving-your-data-to-disk\nDatabases and Collections:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/\nDocuments in MongoDB:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/\nPractice on a web Mongo shell:\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb_terminal_online.php\nEnvironment Variables:\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/working-with-environment-variables-in-node-js.html\nMongoDB SQL comparison:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sql-comparison/\n\n"},"others/git-desktop-workshop.html":{"url":"others/git-desktop-workshop.html","title":"Github Desktop Workshop","keywords":"","body":"Github and Github Desktop - Week 1\nLearning Objectives\n\nYou will be able to create a repository on Github\nYou will be able to clone a repository using Github Desktop\nYou will be able to make changes to a repository using Github Desktop\nYou can define what the differences between Git and Github are\nYou can use git to submit all your homeworks to Github\n\n\nSetup\nIt is important that all of the attendees have access to the CodeYourFuture Github Teams.

This can be food, hobbies or places. It's completely up to you!\n\nBe careful! Don't all add words at the same time!\nBranching\nSometimes it can be useful to work on something for a long time before showing it to everyone. This is why we use branching.\nThe teacher should\n\nShow how you can create a branch in Github Desktop\nShow how moving between Master and the Branch keeps two versions of the file\n\nExercise\nAll students should now\n1.

Explain the benefits of well named methods in\nprogramming and (maybe?) touch on naming conventions.\n\nGetting started with JavaScript\nWe will spend most of this lesson in Codepen. To get started, go to\nhttps://codepen.io/pen to create a new Pen. On the bottom left,\nclick the \"Console\" button to open the console.\n\nYou can place your cursor right behind the > sign. Type a simple expression,\nsuch as 2 + 2 and hit enter. You will see expression, as well as its result,\nin the window above.\n\nYou will be able to follow most of this session along just entering expressions\nin the console like this.\nVariables and assignments\nFor an expression or a value to be of any use to us, we need to store it in a\nvariable.\nVariables have a name (identifier) that we can use to refer to a value. You\ncan assign a value to a variable with the following statement:\nvar x = 3;\n^   ^ ^ ^\n|   | | value\n|   | assignment operator\n|   identifier\ndeclaration statement\n\nLet's break this statement down:\n\nvar: With the var statement we tell the JavaScript engine that x is now\na variable\nx: The variable name/identifier. It can be short or long, but must not\ncontain spaces and must not start with a number.\n=: The equal sign is the assigmnent operator\n3: The value that we assign to the variable. This can be any number, string\nor boolean, or any more complex data type that we will introduce later. You\ncan also use an existing variable here.\n;: THe semicolon is not strictly needed, but is generally used to terminate\na statement.\n\nNow you can use the identifier instead of the actual value in an expression:\nx + x, x * x, console.log(x)\nSimple data types & Expressions\nNumbers\nLet's start with something seemingly simple - numbers. Here are some:\n1;\n15;\n3195803798;\n1.4;\n0.0000005;\n0 - 23;\n\nYou will see that there are whole numbers (no decimal point) and real numbers\n(decimal point), which in JavaScript are so-called “floating point” numbers.\nNumbers can be positive or negative and they support all the basic math\noperators that you would expect:\n2 + 2; // 4\n2 - 5; // -3\n2 * 3; // 6\n10 / 2; // 5\n3 * -2; // -6\n\nOperators have the same precedence as in algebra: * and / have higher\nprecedence than + and -.\n\nTODO: Do math exercise\nTODO: What about Infinity, Math.PI, IEEE floating point bullshit, NaN\n\nStrings\nStrings represent any sort of text. They are delimited by single quotes (') or\ndouble quotes (”) and can be of any length.\n'' // empty string\n\"\" // empty string\n'Hello'\n'I am learning JavaScript'\n'It\\'s been a great journey so far!'\n\"Double quotes work as well\"\n\n\nIf you need single or double quotes inside the string, you need to “escape”\nthem by putting a backslash in front of them. If you don't do this, the\nJavaScript engine will think the string ends here, because it encounters a\nquote.\n\nThe most common operation on strings is to append one string to another. This is\ncalled string concatenation. It's achieved by the plus (+) operator:\n\"Hello\" + \"World\" // \"HelloWorld\"\n\n\nTODO: Introduce string concatenation\nTODO: What about basic string functions, like substr, replace etc?\n\nBooleans\nBooleans are a data type that\ncan only have two values: true and false.\nLike numbers, they can be combined using operators, but there are different\noperators for booleans (analoguous to\nBoolean algebra). The most\nimportant ones are:\n\n! (NOT), which negates a value:\n\n!true; // false\n!false; // true\n\n\n&& (AND), which is only true if both operands are true:\n\nfalse && false; // false\ntrue && false; // false\nfalse && true; // false\ntrue && true; // true\n\n\n|| (OR), which is true if at least one of the operands is true:\n\nfalse && false; // false\ntrue && false; // true\nfalse && true; // true\ntrue && true; // true\n\nTODO: When to introduce truthiness and falsiness? Probably in comparisons?\n\n\nExercise: Put simple mathematical expressions into the console: 2 * 2,\n2 + 2, 5 * 7 - 13 > Exercise: Calculate the area of a circle (r * r *\npi). Do a quick Google search on how to use PI in JavaScript.\nSee what happens when you \"add\" two strings together\nResearch the JS Math library. sqrt, floor, ceil, round\nWrite an expression that outputs the percentage of students who are female.\nMake it so it outputs it as 58%, and make sure you use the actual numbers of\nwomen and the total number of students. Solution: console.log(Math.round(7 /\n17 * 100) + \"%\");\n\nFrom REPL to console.log\n\nSingle expressions are not very useful, you want to write applications\nMore than one statement?

You have created a new database.\nNow type again show dbs\nadmin          0.000GB\nlocal          0.000GB\n\n??? Where is our new database? ???\n\nLazy initialisation.\n\nDatabases\nCollections and Documents\nCollections are like tables in SQL databases.\nInitialising a collection is also happening lazily like this:\n> db.Student.insert({name: 'alex'})\nNow if we run again show dbs after we create a collection with a document\nwe will see that the database appears in the list.\nThis is because at the moment that we inserted this document,\nthe document was created, which in turn created the collection\nwhich in turn created the database.\nExercise 1\nInsert a new student with name: Mary\nExercise 2\nInsert a new student with name: Madeline and id=2 (integer)\nExercise 3\nInsert a new student with name: Steve, midterm score of 80 and final score of 100\nScores should be embedded in a sub-document like this:\nscores:\n{\n  midterm: 0,\n  final: 0\n}\n\nFinding Documents\nFinding a document by a single attribute:\n> db.Student.find({name: 'alex'})\n\nQuerying embedded attributes:\n> db.Student.find({\"scores.midterm\": {$gte: 40}} )\n\nAND / OR queries:\n> db.Student.find({\"$or\": [{\"scores.midterm\": {$gt: 60}}, {\"scores.final\": {$lte: 75}}]} )\n\nExercise 4a\nFind the user Mary that you inserted in exercise 1\nExercise 4b\nSearch for students that have scored between [50,80)\nin midterm AND [80,100] in final exam\nIn these two examples above we can see the operators\nGreaterThanEquals >=, GreaterThan > and LessThanEquals \nAll operators in MongoDB:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/\nUpdating Documents\nUpdating documents has 2 parts.\nThe first one is finding the document(s) we want to update\nand the second one is modifying their values.\n(!)\ndb.Student.update({name: 'alex'}, {name: 'alexander'})\n\nWhat will this command do?\nREPLACE the first instance of document matching {name:'alex'}\nwith the new {name:'alexander'} !!!!\nDefinitely not what we want...\n> db.Student.update({name: 'alex'}, {$set: {name: 'alexander'}})\n\nWe can also use other operators like $inc, $mul, $min, $max\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/#fields\n(!) Update by default will update only the first instance it matches.\nmulti:true\n(!) We can get update to update or create the document by using upsert:true\nExercise 5\nUpdate the student madeline that you created back in exercise 2\nto have midterm score of 50 and final score of 100 respectively.\nExercise 6\nUpdate the grades of all students to be 90\n(!) How could we boost the grades of all students by 10%? (!)\nDeleting documents\nDeleting a single or more documents is as simple as:\n> db.Student.remove({\"_id\":ObjectId(\"5a99e1209056c9e237d071d9\")})\nWriteResult({ \"nRemoved\" : 1 })\n\nDeleting a whole collection:\ndb.Student.drop()\n\nDeleting a database:\ndb.dropDatabase() to delete the current database\nExercise 7\nDelete user steve that you created back in exercise 3\nExercise 8\nDelete all users with midterm score less than 80\nLesson 4 - Administration\nScripting the shell\nThere are several ways to write scripts for MongoDB shell:\n\nuse mongo \nuse mongo mongo_script.js\n\nWhat's the difference?\nThe first one will pipe in our script and execute its lines one by one\nas if we were typing them in Mongo shell.\nThe second one will evaluate our javascript and attempt to run it with Mongo shell.\nAlways test scripts locally in MongoDB (and in general).\nAlways test in staging before production.\nAlways keep backups in production.\nAnd test that you can restore from these backups regualarly.\nAll of these are important for every database system\nbut even more important in MongoDB as...\nTHERE IS NO ROLLBACK! There are no transactions.\nOnce you delete something, it's gone.\nExercise 9\nUsing MongoDB shell, create a script to output in a new collection\nnamed BoostedStudents one document for every document in Student collection\nwith their final grade being boosted by 10%.\nAggregation\nWhy aggregation framework?\nAggregation framework in MongoDB is modelled\nafter the familiar concept of data processing pipelines.\nDocuments enter the pipeline with the MongoDB structure\nand exit the other end transformed into BSON documents with calculated fields.\nCommands in a pipeline are executed sequentially\nand in the order that they appear in the array [].\n\n\n\nSQL\nAggregation framework\n\n\n\n\nWHERE / HAVING\n$match\n\n\nGROUP BY\n$group\n\n\nSELECT\n$project\n\n\nORDER BY\n$sort\n\n\nLIMIT\n$limit\n\n\nsum() / count()\n$sum\n\n\naverage()\n$avg\n\n\njoin\n$lookup\n\n\n\ndb.students.aggregate([\n                   1.  { $match: { name: {$regex: /^aA/} } },\n                   2.  { $group: { _id: \"$name\", average: { $avg: \"$scores.final\" } } },\n                   3.  { $sort: { average: -1 } },\n                   4.  { $project: { name: 1, average: 1 } }\n                   ])\n\nWhat does the pipeline above do?\n\nmatches all documents with a name starting from aA\ngroups them by average final score\nsorts them by average score\nprojects(selects) name and average score in the output\n\nWhat's the output like?\n{_id: .., name: .., average: ..}\n\nMore information: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/\nExercise 10\nNow let's redo Exercise 9 using the aggregation framework.\nReplication\nReplication in MongoDB is used to increase redundancy and data availability.\nIn its essence it's a way for 3 or more (or even 2 with some caveats..)\nservers to keep the same copy of data.\n\nWrites always go to the primary and get propagated asynchronously to the secondaries.\nReads can go to the primary or any of the secondaries.\nElection process:\nReplica sets implement by default automatic failover.\nIf a primary server fails, the remaining secondaries will elect the new primary.\nThis will by default be the secondary that is most \"up to date\" with the primary\nbut we can affect (rig) the election process\nby assigning different votes to each server.\nMore information:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-elections/\nUsing replication we can perform a few interesting tasks:\n\ndelayed replica for backup.\nDelay backups by an hour, enabling us to recover from dropping a database in production\nhidden replicas for reporting.\nThese replicas will never become primaries\nso we can safely apply read load to them for reporting purposes\nreplicas in different location for disaster recovery\nreplicas in different location to be closer to our users\n\nSharding\nSharding is a method for horizontal scaling that MongoDB uses.\nIt essentially partitions data across the shard key in different servers\nthereby distributing the read and write load.\nWhat is horizontal scaling?\nWhen our data exceeds the disk space, I/O capacity and/or memory available\nin a single server we have two options:\n\nBuy/Rent a bigger server. This is vertical scaling.\nIt's of course the easiest way to scale\nbut does not scale linearly in terms of cost and capacity.\nDistribute our data across different servers of the same initial capacity.\nThis is called horizontal scaling, is more difficult to achieve\nbut theoretically if we achieve linear scaling\nthen our system can be infinitely scaleable.\n\nWith MongoDB it's important to understand that we will start with #1\nfor as long as it makes financial sense.\nIf we are on AWS it will probably be easier to tweak our replica set\nfrom S to M to L sized servers rether than implement sharding.\nAt some point though, we should start planning for sharding,\ndefinitely sooner rather than later.\n\nSharding as we can see from the diagram above is not a trivial task.\nWe need router(s) config servers and shards.\nRouter:\nThe router is essentially our query server.\nQueries no longer go to individual servers\nbut must go to the router which will decide which server(s) hold our data.\nConfig Servers:\nConfig servers are holding configuration information for the whole cluster.\nThey must be deployed as a replica set in order to achieve high availability.\nShards:\nEach shard is essentially a replica set.\nEach shard holds a cut of our data\nand all the shards together hold the total of our data.\nMore information:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/\nWhat's next\nIf you have time and interest,\nplease register to this class or any other class in MongoDB university.\nAll classes are free and on average require 6-10 hours of time per week.\nhttps://university.mongodb.com/courses/M001/about\nShameless plug\nI am also the author of the Mastering MongoDB 3.X book by Packt publishing,\navailable here.\n"},"others/coding-standards.html":{"url":"others/coding-standards.html","title":"Coding Standards and Best Practices","keywords":"","body":"Coding Standards and Best Practices\nGeneral\n\nIndentation should be consistent\n\nI.e. all files should use either tabs or spaces and the same width (e.g. 4\ncharacters)\nDo not mix tabs and spaces\n\n\nUse one casing style\n\nUsually:\ncamelCase for JavaScript\nhyphen-case or camelCase for CSS\n\n\nDo not mix casing styles e.g. let first_name = person.firstName;\n\n\nTest coverage should be sufficient\n\nThis should meet or exceed the configured threshold; if this isn't possible,\nexplain why\n\n\nComment code that might be difficult to understand...\n...but also consider simplifying complex code if at all possible.

If students are struggling with the basics, have them go through this CSS Introduction course, starting with the CSS Syntax lesson. Mentors should help guide them through and identify where they're struggling.\nStudents should set the button background color using the .btn-primary selector, and adjust the white button using the .btn-secondary selector. If they use the .btn selector, they'll effect both buttons. When they do that, use it as a lesson in how Object-Oriented CSS works and how to choose the right selector.\nBox Model\nFor the second exercise, the answer will look something like this:\n.nav-link {\n  border: 1px solid transparent;\n}\n.nav-link:hover,\n.nav-link:focus {\n  border-color: #ce5f31;\n}\n\nGit\nThis will be the most challenging for students.

They shouldn't shrink the text on small screens, but enlarge it on bigger screens.\n/* Don't */\n@media (max-width: 480px) {\n  .jumbotron .display-3 {\n    font-size: 3rem;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Do */\n.jumbotron .display-3 {\n  font-size: 3rem;\n}\n@media (min-width: 480px) {\n  .jumbotron .display-3 {\n    font-size: 4.5rem;\n  }\n}\n\nWhen completing the second exercise, make sure they're only modifying the buttons in the jumbotron. The button in the header shouldn't be effected.\nContent Layout: Flexbox\nThis lesson is really just intended to get them a bit familiar with flexbox, media queries and thinking about different viewports when doing their layouts. Make sure that students are not relying on Bootstrap's grid when completing these exercises. Make sure they're only using flexbox in min-width media queries, and that they're applying sensible class naming patterns and wrapping elements where necessary.\nWhen they add a background and border to the \"Learn More\" articles, make sure they're adding padding so the text doesn't go right up to the edge. If they are using px units, nudge them towards em and explain that em is often preferred because it scales well when you need to change font size for different viewports.\nHomework\nWhen checking their use of flexbox in their webpage, make sure they're using gutters where appropriate and that they're using the kinds of design patterns you would expect to see on a website (ie - items line up, text is proportionate, etc).\n"},"html-css/week-3/mentors.html":{"url":"html-css/week-3/mentors.html","title":"HTML/CSS - Week 3","keywords":"","body":"HTML/CSS 3 - Mentor's Outline\nThis outline provides tips to help mentors guide students to the best answers or outcomes for the lesson topics and exercises.\nResources\n\nBootstrap Demo\n\nArticles\n\nWhat is design system - Please scroll the bottom for explanation in the FAQs\n\nQuizzes\n\nHTML/CSS Quick Quiz - 19/05/2020\nCreated by Scotland and Nate\n\n\nHTML/CSS Quick Quiz - 18/04/2020\nCreated by Manchester and Anthony Tran\n\n\n\nOpen-source HTML/CSS Frameworks\nUsing the Navbar color schemes, use the browser's dev tools to show how changing the navbar classes in the example website changes the look based on Bootstrap.\nUsing the Card example, try to illustrate the way tags are nested inside of each other in a specific hierarchy.

Students should have 4-5 sheets of paper.\n\nThe mentor should write their name at the top of the sheet, and write master below that.\nStudents should clone the main sheet on one of their sheets (git clone), with their name and master on the sheet.\nStudents should take a new sheet of paper. Copy their main sheet, and replace master with feature-branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).\nStudents should write their country of origin on their feature-branch sheet. Then show it to the mentor (git commit, git push and pull request).\nThe mentor should \"merge\" each pull request by copying the country of origin onto their sheet.\nTake a moment to indicate how their local sheet have divered from the mentor's sheet.\nAsk the students to take their master sheet and copy the mentor's sheet (git checkout master and git pull upstream master).\nHave the students take their feature-branch sheet, ball it up, and throw it away (git branch -D feature-branch).\n\nSpend some time with this Git Cheatsheet. Point to your sheets and their sheets and ask them to identify what's in the Upstream Repository, Local Repository, Index and Workspace. Then walk through the whole process from Workspace up:\n\nA student makes a change on their sheet. This change is in the Workspace.\nA student does a git add. This change is now in the Index.\nA student does a git commit. This change is now in the Local Repository.\nA student does a git push. This change is now in the Remote Repository.\n\nPersonal Websites\nThe goal of this exercise is to identify students who are struggling to keep up. Try to identify where a student is struggling:\n\nCan they find their files quickly?\nAre they using the command line when appropriate?\nDo they understand how their HTML and CSS interact?\nDo they seem to understand syntax, or are they writing code in the wrong place?\n\nIf you find a student who is struggling with any of these basics, try to work through them together, then give them a short assignment where they need to do something on their own.\nThere will be several students who have the basics down. If they do, push them on some of the higher-level abstract concepts, like re-usable HTML/CSS components, and using CSS specificity cleverly (eg - basic and primary buttons). Beyond that, let them read up on HTML Forms (links in the resources), do some of the advanced suggestions in the syllabus, or challenge them to read and implement BEM naming syntax.\n"},"js-core-1/week-1/mentors.html":{"url":"js-core-1/week-1/mentors.html","title":"JavaScript I - Week 1","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes\nPresentations\n\nWeek 1 - JS Core 1 [Google Slides] - 01/05/2020\nFunction demo\nCreated by Manchester and Anthony Tran\n\n\nWeek 1 Midweek Catch-up - JS Core 1 [Google Slides] - 01/05/2020\nCreated by Scotland and Richard Darby\n\n\n\nVideos\n\nFunctions, Variables and Bees - An Introduction to JS1-1 Concepts\nCreated by Scotland and Rares Matei\n\n\n\nWhat worked well\n\nHaving all the exercises for the module in the js-exercises repo works well.\n\nThings to improve\n\nArray methods in syllabus seem outdated / not the most useful.\n\ne.g. setting a new array value using the [x] notation should be replaced with .push()\nAlso suggest adding filter() to array methods section.\n\n\nCan we introduce arrow functions here?

Not sure if this is just a good opportunity to teach typeof, or if it distracts from the point of the lesson i.e. predicates?\nStudents make some confusions between the function definition and the function call during the tdd exercises. They try to reuse the values or the variables passed as parameters when calling the function inside the function itself. For Example, given the definition: function addOne(numbers) and the call: addOne(myArray), students try to use the name myArray inside the function or they think that the parameter in the function definition should be called myArray...\n\n"},"js-core-1/week-2/mentors.html":{"url":"js-core-1/week-2/mentors.html","title":"JavaScript I - Week 2","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes\nPresentations\n\nWeek 2 - JS Core 1 [Google Slides] - 01/05/2020\nCreated by Manchester Volunteers\n\n\n\nQuiz\n\nWeek 1 & 2 Quiz - 19/05/2020\nCreated by Scotland Volunteers\n\n\n\nNotes\n"},"js-core-1/week-3/mentors.html":{"url":"js-core-1/week-3/mentors.html","title":"JavaScript I - Week 3","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes\nPresentations\n\nWeek 3 - JS Core 1 [Google Slides] - 01/05/2020\nCreated by Manchester Volunteers\n\n\n\nResources\n\nQuiz - Git vs Github, Arguments vs Parameters - (07/05/2020)\nQuiz - JavaScript 1 Recap - (10/05/2020)\nThis can be done in class or set as homework.\n\n\nSelf-Assessment - JavaScript Core 1\nCreated by London and Chris Owen\n\n\n\nNotes\n"},"js-core-2/week-1/mentors.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-1/mentors.html","title":"JavaScript II - Week 1","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes\nPresentations\n\nWeek 1 - JS Core 2 [Google Slides] - 14/05/2020\nResources\nCreated by Manchester and Abdoulrazack\n\n\nArrays of Objects [Google Slides] - 04/06/2020\nCreated by Scotland Volunteers\n\n\n\nVideos\n\nCooking with JavaScript Objects - 04/06/2020\nCreated by Scotland Volunteers & Rares Matei\n\n\n\nNotes\n"},"js-core-2/week-2/mentors.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-2/mentors.html","title":"JavaScript II - Week 2","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes\nPresentations\n\nWeek 2 - JS Core 2 [Google Slides] - 26/05/2020\nResources\nCreated by Manchester and Abdoulrazack\n\n\n\nNotes\n"},"js-core-2/week-3/mentors.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-3/mentors.html","title":"JavaScript II - Week 3","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes\nQuiz\n\nEnd of Module Quiz - [Google Form] - 04/06/2020\nCreated by London and Antigoni Makri\n\n\nEnd of Module Quiz - [Google Form] - 28/05/2020\nCreated by Chris Owen\n\n\n\nPresentations\nNotes\nExercise - Synchronous vs Asynchronous\nThe aim of this exercise is to enable students to define the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code.This should be run in small groups and TAs should make sure that there's a dicussion about the order of the expected results.\nThe main messages to be delivered here are:\n\nIn synchronous programmes, if you have two lines of code (L1 followed by L2), then L2 cannot begin running until L1 has finished executing. You can imagine this as if you are in a line of people waiting to buy train tickets. You can't begin to buy a train ticket until all the people in front of you have finished buying theirs. Similarly, the people behind you can't start buying their tickets until you have bought yours.\n\nIn asynchronous programmes, you can have two lines of code (L1 followed by L2), where L1 schedules some task to be run in the future, but L2 runs before L1's task completes. Picture eating at a sit-down restaurant. Other people order their food. You can also order your food. You don't have to wait for them to receive their food and finish eating before you order. Similarly, other people don't have to wait for you to get your food and finish eating before they can order. Everybody will get their food as soon as it is finished cooking.\n\n\nThe Network Tab\nThe most important part of the Network Tab to explain is the relationship between the HTML file and the requests that are subsequently made.\nThat is to say that when a HTML is parsed that GET requests are made to the resources that are required to view the page. This can be shown by\n\nShowing how a JavaScript file is referenced in a  tag and is then loaded in the Network Tab\nShowing how an  tag referenced a src attribute and the image is loaded in the Network Tab\n\nExercise - GET Requests\nThe aim of this exercises to let the students explore the network tab and spending some time reading code.\nWhen the class has submitted their lists open the network tab and see exactly what was requested by the website.

The idea is to give debugging a greater importance that just \"making my code work\" and that good and thorough debugging is of vital importance.\nYou should play the videos to the students and have a short discussion around the questions posed.\nThe Debugging Mindset\nTo bring the lesson back more to the students day to day lives - the students should have short groups discussions around the bugs that they've experienced in the past.\nTry to keep the discussion focussed around the bugs that the students have had and not the solutions to the bugs. This will come later!\nFraming their answers in the context of the type of error they are is a good way to engage the students with the next part of the class.\nEncouraging the students to open up about the problems they have faced is part of a theme of 'normalising' bugs in code - it is important to reinforce that bugs are a part of life, they don't mean you suck!\nTypes of Errors\nBy outlining some of the most common errors that students see, we aim to give them answers to the errors they see most often.\nTake the time to the run code if necessary for the more complex issues and see if you can fix them in the class.\nTools\nThis section can be quite lecture heavy so make sure to demonstrate the tools that you're using as much as possible in a browers and using live coding.\nTry to elicit answers from the students about when these tools might be useful for solving different kinds of bugs. If any of the students have used these tools before then elicit answers around when they've used them in the past.\nExercise 1\nThese are the errors:\n• Homer string syntax: apostrophe not escaped (syntax)\n• for loop: off-by-one error on check (logical)\n• Incorrect calling of the function (other)\n• Typo (typerror on k) (other)\nProject Setup\nPlease take some time to fully explore the project and what the students are trying to achieve over three weeks.\nThe most important message to send is that the students should move at their own pace and only continue to the next level when they understand the current one.\nYou should walk the students through the setup guide and use the rest of the lesson to make a start on the project in groups.\nQuiz\nYou should reserve 10-15 minutes at the end of the lesson to run through the following summative assessment with the students. Have the students answer all the questions in the quiz and submit their answers before leaving for the day.\nSolutions\n\nPossible answers:\n\n- To prevent bugs being released into production and having negative consequences on users - such as with Therac-25.\n- Because finding bugs is harder the more complex the code gets. It is better to test little and often.\n2.\nA - False: A bug is when the program is not behaving as expected. This can be due to logic problems rather than compile or runtime errors.\nB - False: Rubber ducking is a common method to debug problems and can involve talking through the problem with another person.\nC - True: When your program is not working as expected, start by asking yourself the questions in the debugging framework.\nD - True: Breakpoints are used to pause the execution of code.\n3.\nTo `Step through the code` means to go line-by-line through the code and check what the state of the program is by looking at the values of variables or expressions on that line.\nWe use this method when debugging, so that we can pinpoint on which line our program begins to behave unexpectedly.\n4.\nA - True (Some at least, though not all)\nB - True\nC - False\nD - True\n5.\n1. Add the word `debugger` into the line of code where you want to pause.\n2.

But we don't really want students to learn the bad habits here (we want them to ultimately learn state), so they are hidden away.\n\n\n\nState\n\nThis section takes a bit of a risk - it deliberately shows the wrong way trying to do state, then refactors to fix it\nBefore fixing the problem, something to emphasise is the moment when we start using the virtual DOM for the first time\nWhen we trigger a manual re-render to ReactDOM.render()\nBut we are updating the DOM here - we mentioned in lesson 1 that this was hard, and now we've got an easy way of updating it. This is the true power of React\nThe demo is not very impressive, so it's easy for the students to miss\n\n\nWe cover the problems with using a global variable, so hopefully that is enough to prevent the students copy/pasting the wrong way\nEnsure that you emphasise this is the wrong way to do state\n\n\nDemonstrate the app with multiple counters\nShows that each components remembers their own state separate to other components\n\n\nWhen to use props or state?\nMy rule of thumb: use props until you need it to change over time, then switch to state\n\n\nContainer components\nTo be honest I kept this in here as a hold over from previous lessons\nArguably it's less relevant recently in React\nIf you're short on time then it can be skipped\n\n\n\nInteractive Example Index\n\nRecap\nFunction reference vs function call recap\nEvent Handlers\nPassing Functions as Props\nRe-Rendering Components\nComponent variables resetting on re-render\nImporting useState Hook\nInitialising and rendering useState variables\nUsing array index syntax\nUsing array destructuring\nUpdating state\nDon't Mutate State\nMultiple state variables\nWhen to Use Props or State\n\nExercise solutions\n\nBestPokemonFetcher exercise (completed)\n\n"},"react/week-3/mentors.html":{"url":"react/week-3/mentors.html","title":"React - Week 3","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes - React 3\nResources\n\nQuiz - React Module - 28/04/2019\nCreated by London and Ali Smith\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\nPokeDex In-Class - Exercise Solution - 05/06/2020\nCreated by London and Ali Smith\n\n\n\nNotes for mentors\nUpdating data when props change\n\"Lifecycle\" of a component\nWith Hooks, we don't really talk about the \"lifecycle\" of a component any more, but this section is intended to show exactly what happens at each step in the code.\nWalking through the code like this is sometimes called \"playing computer\". A step-by-step description has been provided in the syllabus, but this was intended as revision material. It is recommended to keep the code example on the screen and walk through each line together with the students.\nTo keep students engaged, it can be useful to ask them to predict what the next step does. This also allows you to get feedback on whether a student is following or not.\nAt the end of the \"playing computer\" ask whether the students have spotted the bug in the logic: the effect is not updating when the prop changes. Therefore the key point to emphasize is that useEffect is not queued when the component re-renders.\nESLint rule for React Hooks\nEmphasize that the rule likely knows best, so if it suggests adding a dependency it is recommended to add it.\nInteractive Example Index\n\nState recap\nData fetching recap\nEffects with prop updates (not working) (used in \"playing computer\" exercise)\nEffects with prop updates (working)\nFetch with loading state (on initial load)\nFetch with loading state (between prop changes)\nControlled component\nControlled component with multiple fields\nObject spread operator\nObject spread operator with overrides\nComputed property names\n\nExercise solutions\n\nBestPokemonSelector component for copying into dependencies array exercise\nBestPokemonSelector exercise (starting point after copy/pasting)\nBestPokemonSelector exercise (completed)\nCaughtPokemon exercise (starting point)\nCaughtPokemon exercise (completed)\n\n"},"node/week-1/mentors.html":{"url":"node/week-1/mentors.html","title":"Node - Week 1","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes\nPresentations\nNotes\n"},"node/week-2/mentors.html":{"url":"node/week-2/mentors.html","title":"Node - Week 2","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes\nPresentations\nNotes\n"},"node/week-3/mentors.html":{"url":"node/week-3/mentors.html","title":"Node - Week 3","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes\nPresentations\nNotes\n"},"db/week-1/mentors.html":{"url":"db/week-1/mentors.html","title":"Databases - Week 1","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes\nWhat worked well\nThings to improve\nOther thoughts\n"},"db/week-2/mentors.html":{"url":"db/week-2/mentors.html","title":"Databases - Week 2","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes\nWhat worked well\nThings to improve\nOther thoughts\n"},"db/week-3/mentors.html":{"url":"db/week-3/mentors.html","title":"Databases - Week 3","keywords":"","body":"Mentor's Notes\nWhat worked well\nThings to improve\nOther thoughts\n"}}}
