> Please make sure you've forked [the js-exercises repo](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises) at the start of the class. This is the repo we will use during the class, and for homework.

## Prerequisites

1. Access to a Linux console (either on Mac, Ubuntu or by using Ubuntu WSL for Windows 10)
1. VS Code running a default Linux terminal
1. NodeJS must be installed

To test, you can write `node -v` in your terminal and you should see something like `v11.10.0`. If you don't see this please talk to a teacher!

## Hello World

It is programming tradition that the first thing you do in any language is make it output 'Hello world!'.

We'll do this in JavaScript, using a command called `console.log()`. The `console.log()` method writes a message to the console.

The console is a tool which is mainly used to log information - it's useful for testing purposes.

### Exercise (10 minutes)

_(This exercise will help you understand how to run a basic JS script and explore the different ways you can run JS code)_

1. Create your first `js1-week1.js` script
2. Type `console.log("Hello World!")`
3. There are 2 ways you can run this script - one way is by pressing F5 in your VS Code application. Can you find out what the second way is? Pair up and use a search engine to find out! Choose your favourite method and use that from now on.

**BONUS:** there is a third way of running JS code (notice how I haven't said scipt) - do you know what that is?

### Exercise (5 minutes)

_(This exercise will help you expand your understanding of console.log)_

Write 10 statements like these, but in different languages.

For example:

```
Halo, dunia! // Indonesian
Ciao, mondo! // Italian
Hola, mundo! // Spanish
```

## Variables

When you write code, you'll want to create shortcuts to data values so you don't have to write out the same value every time.

We can use a _variable_ to create a reference to a value. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.

Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with _let_ and _const_ keywords as follows.

```js
let greeting = "Hello world";

console.log(greeting);
```

```js
const name = "Irina";

console.log(name);
```

The program above will print "Hello world" to the console. Notice how it uses the value assigned to the variable `greeting`.

### Exercise (5 minutes)

1. Add a variable `greeting` to js1-week1.js and assign a greeting of your choice to the variable
2. Print your `greeting` to the console 3 times. You should see your greeting 3 times on the console, one on each line.

## Strings

In programming there are different _types of_ data. You've used one data type already: **string**.

Computers recognise strings as a sequence of characters but to humans, strings are simply lines of text.

```js
const message = "This is a string";
```

Notice that strings are always wrapped **inside of quote marks**. We do this so that the computer knows when the string starts and ends.

You can check that the data is a string by using the `typeof` operator:

```js
const message = "This is a string";
const messageType = typeof message;

console.log(messageType); // logs 'string'
```

### Exercise (5 minutes)

1. Write a program that:

- creates a variable called `colors`
- assigns colors "blue" and "yellow" as a comma separate string to `colors`
- logs the type `colors` using `typeof`.

2. What is the `typeof` a number?

## String concatenation

You can add two strings together using the plus operator (`+`) or _string interpolation_.

String interpolation is a useful JavaScript feature that allows you to put variables directly into a string:

```js
// Here is an example using the plus operator to concat strings
const greetingStart = "Hello, my name is ";
const name = "Daniel";

const greeting = greetingStart + name;

console.log(greeting); // Logs "Hello, my name is Daniel"
```

```js
// Here is example using the String interpolation to concat strings
const greetingStart = "Hello";
const name = "Daniel";

const greeting = `${greetingStart}, my name is ${name}`;

console.log(greeting); // Logs "Hello, my name is Daniel"
```

### Exercise (5 mins)

1. Write a program that logs a message with a greeting and your name using the two concatenation methods we used

## Numbers as integers

The next data type we will learn is **number**.

Unlike strings, numbers do not need to be wrapped in quotes.

```js
const age = 30;
```

You can use mathematical operators to calculate numbers:

```js
const sum = 10 + 2; // 12
const product = 10 * 2; // 20
const quotient = 10 / 2; // 5
const difference = 10 - 2; // 8
```

### Exercise (10 mins)

1. Create two variables `numberOfStudents` and `numberOfMentors`
2. Log a message that displays the total number of students and mentors

#### Expected result

```sh
Number of students: 15
Number of mentors: 8
Total number of students and mentors: 23
```

## Numbers as decimals

Numbers can be integers (whole numbers) or floats (numbers with a decimal).

```js
const preciseAge = 30.612437;
```

Numbers with decimals can be rounded to the nearest whole number using the `Math.round` function:

```js
const preciseAge = 30.612437;
const roughAge = Math.round(preciseAge); // 31
```

### Exercise (15 mins)

1. Using the variables provided in the exercise calculate the percentage of mentors and students in the group (percentages must be a rounded to the nearest integer)
2. Using online documentation, what other things can you do with the `Math` library? Pick one thing on your table that you can do other than `Math.round` and prepare an explanation for the rest of the class

#### Expected result

```sh
Percentage students: 65%
Percentage mentors: 35%
```

## Functions

Functions are blocks of code that can do a task as many times as you ask them to. They take an input and return an output.

Here's a function that doubles a number:

```js
function double(number) {
  return number * 2;
}
```

To use the function we need to:
a) _call_ it with an input and
b) do something with the returned value, for example assigning it to a variable

```js
const result = double(2);

console.log(result); // 4
```

The input given to a function is called a **parameter**.

A function can take more than one parameter:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

When you write a function (sometimes called _declaring a function_) you assign names to the parameters inside of the parentheses (`()`). Parameters can be called anything.

This function is exactly the same as the on above:

```js
function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

### Exercise (20 minutes)

1. In pairs, design and create a function that:

- takes in more than one input
- uses string concatenation
- this means adding two strings together
- performs some form of operation on a number
- uses `return` to return a **string**

2. Add a comment above your function to explain what it does
3. Call your function and run your script
4. What's the difference between a `return` and `console.log`?
5. When would you choose to use functions over the way we have been scripting so far?

### Exercise (10 minutes)

1. Swap your laptop with your neighbouring pair and review each other's code - what can be improved? Is the code readable?

## Calling functions inside functions

Functions are very powerful.

- You can write more than one line of code inside of functions.
- You can use variables inside of functions.
- You can call other functions inside of functions!

```js
function getAgeInDays(age) {
  return age * 365;
}

function createGreeting(name, age) {
  const ageInDays = getAgeInDays(age);
  const message =
    "My Name is " + name + " and I was born over " + ageInDays + " days ago!";
  return message;
}
```

### Exercise (20 mins)

1. Write a function that returns the year someone is born given their age as input
2. Using the answer from step 1, write a function that takes someone's name and age as input and returns a string that states the person's name and year they were born in a sentence
